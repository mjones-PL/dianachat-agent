PriceLogic Technology: 
PriceLogic’s technology is based on its Cognitive Architecture platform. PriceLogic’s cognitive architecture functions as a unified intelligence system that coordinates multiple specialized AI agents, each maintaining independent decision-making capabilities while sharing a common understanding of your business.

PriceLogic Technology 1. 
The Brain Center (Knowledge Hub) - The central intelligence that connects all agent activities with real-time integration with Amazon data. The Brain Center learns dynamically from past decisions and outcomes.

PriceLogic Technology 2. 
Specialized Agents (Agent Domain): Each agent masters a specific role (pricing, inventory, support). Insights are shared across the team for enhanced decision-making. Agents operate autonomously but are coordinated.

PriceLogic Technology 3. 
Safety and Control (Guardrails): Rule-based constraints and detailed audit trails ensure responsible and traceable actions. Simple controls allow users to review, pause, or override decisions at any time.
