<h4 class="wp-block-heading">DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS &amp; BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT</h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">CREDENTIALS</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bachelor of Psychology, Middlebury College, Middlebury, Vermont</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PROFESSIONAL</h5>



<p>Carrie began her career working at a therapeutic boarding school in 2001.  Watching young men and women gain insight and maturity while preparing for the next steps in their lives inspired Carrie to seek further career opportunities in the mental health field.  The passion people possess once they can get a handle on their challenges is unmatched. Transitioning into a role as Admissions Director in 2004 was a natural move for Carrie. Being able to follow families from the first phone call all the way through to graduation is inspiring and fulfilling. &nbsp;In 2012, excited by the opportunity to work with a unique population and with a well-respected and energetic team, Carrie accepted a job as Director of Admissions at a prestigious residential treatment center, where she remained until 2017.  Carrie is a member of the inaugural director team at Bridge House and is energized to be a part of this unique and innovative approach to assessment and treatment planning, the backbone to any successful outcome in mental health care.&nbsp; Carrie believes in a transparent and open admission process where all questions are fair game and decisions are explained with utmost clarity.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>After growing up in Park City, Utah, Carrie headed East for college, where she competed nationally as a swimmer while studying psychology. Although she loved her time in Vermont, Carrie’s love of western skylines, ski slopes, and bike trails lured her back to Utah. &nbsp;Carrie likes to stay active and cherishes time with friends, family, and her daughter, born in 2015. Attending live music performances &amp; practicing yoga is how Carrie likes to spend her free time when she is not on her bike or skis.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>Human beings are inherently resilient.  Despite what families and individuals have been through before seeking mental health treatment, the outcomes and potential for health, hope, and healing are what keep Carrie coming back to work each day.&nbsp; When people are treated with compassion and respect through the treatment process, families can look back fondly with pride and honor for all that was accomplished.</p>
