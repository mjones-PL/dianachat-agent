<h3 class="wp-block-heading">BROOKE BOUWHUIS, RDN, CD</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">CLINICAL DIETITIAN</h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">CREDENTIALS</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Registered Dietitian Nutritionist &amp; Certified Dietitian, Utah State University, Logan, Utah</li>



<li>Registration and Certification, American Dietetic Association</li>



<li>Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Food Science, Medical Dietetics emphasis; Psychology minor, Utah State University, Logan, Utah</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PROFESSIONAL</h5>



<p>Brooke began her career as a dietitian in the dietary supplement industry.  Having worked in that industry for over 16 years, Brooke has a strong knowledge of the power of supplementation.  She believes that while some supplements can be beneficial, they are not all as revolutionary as we may be led to believe. When the next phase of her career opened, Brooke began&nbsp;creating weight loss menu plans for bloggers and currently works in the wellness industry for a local fitness camp that draws clients worldwide.  Brooke also has one nationally recognized weight management certification from the American Dietetic Association.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brooke loves people and is passionate about helping them heal using the power of food.  Her philosophy on nutrition is firmly on the functional nutrition side of the plate.  The functional power of food that informs her dietetic practice also showed up in her personal life, when Brooke helped her teenage daughter heal from a battle with&nbsp;<em>clostridium difficile</em>&nbsp;<em>colitis</em>.  When this health challenge left Brooke’s daughter with post-infectious IBS, she quickly realized that a handful of medications were not the solution to helping her daughter heal and thrive.  Ultimately, Brooke and her daughter found a food-centered solution by eliminating several triggering foods from her diet.  This solution has kept her daughter not only symptom-free but also medication-free.  From both personal and professional experience, Brooke understands the strong connections between gut health and mental health, and she is constantly advocating this message.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>Brooke can be found on her mountain bike or fat bike, tearing up the trails if not at a track meet or soccer game for her kids.  If there is light still left in the day, Brooke can be found putting around in her organic garden, listening to podcasts, or reading books about health and wellness.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>Brooke believes that hope, healing and health come as individually tailored solutions.  She knows that each resident comes to Bridge House with varied life challenges and needs that make them unique.  Brooke helps them navigate their path to wellness by approaching them from a place of love, patience, and empathy.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">EXECUTIVE CHEF</h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">CREDENTIALS</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Le Grand Diplome’</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PROFESSIONAL</h5>



<p>After graduating from culinary school at Le Cordon Bleu, Louie accepted a position as Sous Chef in a struggling fine dining restaurant. Teaming up with the Executive Chef, they created an eclectic Italian Seafood menu. After growing the restaurant&#8217;s clientele and being named ‘Bay Area&#8217;s best food and entertainment of the year’ awarded 2 years in a row, he decided to go off on his own and help other small restaurant owners grow their businesses. Over the 20 years of Louie’s culinary career, he helped develop and rebrand 14 privately owned restaurants nationwide. Gaining knowledge of different regions&#8217; recipes and styles has allowed Louie to create his unique style of culinary recipes which he calls “Happy Food”.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>When Louie is not creating culinary delights, you will find him either in the mountains, on a lake, or lost on the ocean&#8217;s shores.&nbsp; Louie was born and raised in beautiful Southern California and spent most of his time in the Pacific Ocean. He has lived in several states, from the West Coast to the East Coast and many in between. He is a happy father to 6 children and a grandfather to 1, with another grandchild on the way. He has always had fish as pets, with as many as 12 operating fish tanks simultaneously. Louie feels they are much more fun to watch than television. Louie enjoys football, with his two favorite teams being the Oregon Ducks and Green Bay Packers. He is also a huge fan of the American Hockey League and follows the Ice Dogs. In his free time, Louie experiments with different types of art expression, from canvas painting to chalk or pencil drawing. He loves doing landscape and tree art, all things Mother Earth.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>Health is the foundation of our well-being, and bonds our lives’ physical, mental, and emotional characteristics. The culinary department must maintain the highest standards of quality and nutritional diets for our residents. Having a healthy, consistent diet aids in the healing process. Healthy food in your body will ease the cravings for sweet, fatty, salty concoctions and can reduce high levels of cortisol, stimulate the production of the feel-good hormone dopamine, and increases the level of calming, mood-enhancing serotonin. Hope is the belief that things can get better, even in the face of adversity. Hope is a powerful motivator that helps us overcome challenges and achieve our goals. Healing is the process of restoring health and hope when they have been lost or damaged. It involves caring for ourselves and others, seeking help when needed, and finding the paths our feet are meant to follow. These concepts manifest a powerful framework for living a happy and fulfilling life. <br><br>Working in culinary arts since 1991<br><br>Working at Bridge House since 2023</p>
