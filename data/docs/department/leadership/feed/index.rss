<h3 class="wp-block-heading">ROD ANDRUS, MSW, LCSW, CTT II</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR / FOUNDER</h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">CREDENTIALS</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Master of Social Work, University of Denver, Denver, Colorado</li>



<li>Bachelor of Social Work, Weber State University, Ogden, Utah</li>



<li>Certified Trauma Therapist Level II</li>



<li>Certified to provide clinical supervision</li>



<li>Certified in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PROFESSIONAL</h5>



<p>Rod leads the Bridge House Team and has decades of experience in the field of private residential treatment.  A thoughtful and dynamic leader, he has previously served as Executive Director, Clinical Director, Program Director, and Primary Therapist at some of the most highly regarded treatment programs in the country.  Rod brings to Bridge House not only his clinical verve but also a unique, sophisticated approach to program oversight and management. He is passionate about delivering innovative and ethical mental health treatment in a nurturing and normative setting.</p>



<p>Rod received his graduate degree from the University of Denver.  He is a licensed clinical social worker and certified trauma therapist with more than twenty years of experience in mental health, addiction treatment, and program management.  Since entering the field in 1992, he has delivered treatment to thousands of clients and their families, supervised hundreds of mental health professionals, led three successful organizations, and developed cutting-edge programming now implemented in various treatment settings.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>A recreation and outdoor enthusiast, Rod can be found riding the half-pipe on his snowboard, camping, and fly-fishing in the mountains, or dropping into bowls on his skateboard.  He also&nbsp;enjoys the ongoing adventure of raising two high-spirited children.  In addition to spending time with his&nbsp;children and in the outdoors, Rod loves restoring vintage German cars.  He worked as a chef to put himself through college and uses his culinary talents to the occasional delight of family and friends.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>Rod believes that humans are at their best when their emotional, social, spiritual, physical, and intellectual needs are met.  He refers to this concept as the Spheres Of Healthy Living.&nbsp; All too often, people struggling with mental illness, neuro-cognitive disorders, or addiction have never acquired the knowledge and skill to engage in these spheres effectively or have lost a sense of balance in these spheres of healthy living.&nbsp; Every person’s experience is unique in terms of what they experience regarding hope, health, and healing.&nbsp; For some, an experience of hope motivates them to learn what is required to heal and experience health.&nbsp; For others, they may experience a sense of health and healing, which leads them to believe that they are worthy and capable of living a life of purpose and joy.  Hope, healing, and health are interdependent and can be considered by-products of one another.&nbsp; It is nearly impossible to experience one without the other.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-theme-primary-color has-text-color">DR. CHRIS MCROBERTS</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">DIRECTOR OF DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES / FOUNDER</h4>



<p></p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">CREDENTIALS</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ph.D. Clinical Psychology, Magna Cum Laude, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah</li>



<li>Bachelor of Psychology and Sociology, Minors in Statistics and Philosophy, Magna Cum Laude, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah</li>



<li>Licensed Clinical Psychologist&nbsp;since 1999</li>



<li>Member of the American Psychological Association since 1999</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PROFESSIONAL</h5>



<p>Dr. Chris McRoberts has been conceptualizing the Bridge House model and the prospect of one day providing a place of hope, health, and healing for over 15 years.  Dr. McRoberts began his mental health career in 1992 as a job coach for intellectually disabled adults.  This and other service experiences sparked his desire to learn about and serve people with mental health problems and cognitive differences.  He subsequently committed his career and energy to help others in need.  Research and evidence-based practices have provided the structure for his studies and work with adults and adolescents.  He loves research and has published several peer-reviewed articles and presented research findings at many national conferences on education and mental health.  During his university studies, Dr. McRoberts took part in internships and practicums that exposed him to a wide range of individuals&#8217; emotional and intellectual challenges.  His doctoral program focused on assessing and treating mental disorders and cognitive differences in both children and adults.</p>



<p>Dr. McRoberts worked at the Utah State Hospital, private practice clinics, acute hospital units, a large community mental health center, and public and private schools leading up to his licensure as a Clinical Psychologist in 1999.  Dr. McRoberts founded and built an assessment-based practice in 1998. He supervised fifteen psychologists specializing in educational, neuropsychological, and psychological evaluation of children, adolescents, and adults in Utah, Idaho, New York, and North Carolina.  Through this process, he traveled throughout the United States and internationally, conducting comprehensive psychological and educational evaluations.  He has visited and examined well over 100 schools and therapeutic programs along the way.  Dr. McRoberts has become a recognized expert and supervisor in psychological and cognitive testing and evaluation.  Dr. McRoberts has been on the founding team developing and/or serving as board president for eight prestigious residential treatment and wilderness therapy programs beginning in 2005.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>Dr. McRoberts lived in Oregon, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, California, Spain, St. Maarten, and Tennessee before finally settling in Utah.  Dr. McRoberts loves to listen and hear people’s stories, and he has the uncanny ability to make people feel comfortable and at ease very quickly.  He despises formal settings and occasions and is most comfortable in his flip-flops.  Dr. McRoberts’ favorite person in this world is his wife, Kristy.  He has a passion for different cultures and seeks opportunities to immerse himself in different societies and learn from other people&#8217;s lives.  Dr. McRoberts prioritizes family, including his children (three sons and a daughter) and grandchildren.  He imparted upon his children his thirst for knowledge and adventure, raising them with travel, service, and physical activity as core foundations, introducing them to the power of giving back through humanitarian projects and travel in Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru, Fiji, Thailand, and Spain.</p>



<p>A traditional office therapy job has never been an option for Dr. McRoberts.  He enjoys helping clients by seeing them in their home environments, spending time with them in treatment settings, and collaborating with their treatment teams.  He is invigorated by the challenge of figuring out learning differences and helping people progress to their potential.  Dr. McRoberts also takes pride in employing the people who work in mental health fields.  Seeing employees and their families grow and learn is one of his greatest joys.  Dr. McRoberts sincerely believes that he can accomplish anything that he sets his mind to, and he loves a challenge.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>Dr. McRoberts was born with congenital cataracts.  His parents were told he would never read, ride a bike, or drive.  They were encouraged to protect him.  Instead, they opted to treat him just as they did their other children.  His dad held faith in the hope that Chris could do so much more than the doctors believed.  He bought Chris a bike when he was five, believing that he might give up if he crashed too often.  Chris persevered.  His parents put no boundaries on his abilities, and subsequently, he learned to work around his limitations in unexpected ways.  Dr. McRoberts sees mental health in the same way.  When people have mental illnesses and cognitive disabilities, the focus should remain on what can be accomplished rather than on limitations.  People with all types of mental and physical disabilities can achieve amazing things if provided the opportunity.  Dr. McRoberts wants to remove the stigma of mental illness while helping people with mental health struggles become their best selves.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DR. KIERA SCHLANSKY<br></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MEDICAL DIRECTOR / PSYCHIATRIST</h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">CREDENTIALS</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bachelor of Arts in Biology, University of San Diego</li>



<li>Creighton University School of Medicine</li>



<li>Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Adult Psychiatry Residency Program</li>



<li>Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry Fellowship&nbsp;</li>



<li>Board Certified by American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PROFESSIONAL</h5>



<p>Dr. Schlansky completed undergraduate studies in biology in San Diego, CA, graduating with honors, and then attended medical school in Omaha, Nebraska.  She pursued adult psychiatric training at Vanderbilt University and completed a two-year child &amp; adolescent sub-specialty fellowship.  Psychiatric training at Vanderbilt offered Dr. Schlansky a wealth of opportunities to work with leaders in the field in treating first-break psychosis and mood disorders, substance use disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders with equal focus on psychopharmacology and psychotherapy.  Dr. Schlansky’s interest in both the interpersonal and biological sequelae of attachment during early life leads to her interest in treating children, adolescents, and transitional age youth and the entire family system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Schlansky is passionate about delivering the best evidence-based psychiatric treatment within a collaborative model with the identified patient and their family.  She believes psychiatric diagnosis should be a collaborative process during which both the physician and the patient develop an understanding of current symptomatology and arrive together at a treatment plan in accordance with the patient’s goals and values. Dr. Schlansky is particularly skilled in treating patients with complex presentations that have previously eluded accurate understanding or effective treatment.  Her extensive focus on family therapy during training allows for a deep understanding of the dynamic and genetic factors that may have contributed to a patient’s current presentation.  Her warm, compassionate, and friendly communication style allows for patients and families to feel heard and supported throughout the treatment process.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>Dr. Schlansky lives on a small hobby farm in Utah which she shares with her husband, six goats, a flock of chickens, two pigs, two rabbits, and one very spoiled chihuahua.  When she’s not working on the farm, she enjoys practicing yoga (sometimes with goats), climbing, stand-up paddleboarding, and painting in her home studio.  Her interest in art has expanded into her psychiatric practice in recent years, developing therapeutic art practices for patients to cultivate their creativity and experience the freedom of personal expression.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>Both conceptually and scientifically, mental health treatment has changed considerably in the recent past, and Dr. Schlansky believes that Bridge House’s treatment philosophy represents the next phase in this evolution.  Bridge House offers mental health care in a manner and environment that encourages patients to take their first steps in their personal healing journey and inspires hope for a future on the other side of treatment. We believe that aligning with our patients in this process facilitates movement toward our shared goal of long-lasting health.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>Rachael is a lifelong Utah resident and proud of her Native American heritage, which is a large part of her identity. She is an enrolled member of the Ute Indian Tribe and is also from the Hopi tribe of Arizona. During her free time, Rachael prioritizes her community, spending time with her family and friends.

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>Rachael sees health, hope, and healing as inextricably linked: when one begins to spark, the others naturally follow. She believes that the healing process usually begins with hope, as people develop trust and connections with those around them. She believes that healthy, genuine, and compassionate relationships are the foundation to feeling hope and moving forward in the healing process.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">CREDENTIALS</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bachelor of Psychology, Middlebury College, Middlebury, Vermont</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PROFESSIONAL</h5>



<p>Carrie began her career working at a therapeutic boarding school in 2001.  Watching young men and women gain insight and maturity while preparing for the next steps in their lives inspired Carrie to seek further career opportunities in the mental health field.  The passion people possess once they can get a handle on their challenges is unmatched. Transitioning into a role as Admissions Director in 2004 was a natural move for Carrie. Being able to follow families from the first phone call all the way through to graduation is inspiring and fulfilling. &nbsp;In 2012, excited by the opportunity to work with a unique population and with a well-respected and energetic team, Carrie accepted a job as Director of Admissions at a prestigious residential treatment center, where she remained until 2017.  Carrie is a member of the inaugural director team at Bridge House and is energized to be a part of this unique and innovative approach to assessment and treatment planning, the backbone to any successful outcome in mental health care.&nbsp; Carrie believes in a transparent and open admission process where all questions are fair game and decisions are explained with utmost clarity.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>After growing up in Park City, Utah, Carrie headed East for college, where she competed nationally as a swimmer while studying psychology. Although she loved her time in Vermont, Carrie’s love of western skylines, ski slopes, and bike trails lured her back to Utah. &nbsp;Carrie likes to stay active and cherishes time with friends, family, and her daughter, born in 2015. Attending live music performances &amp; practicing yoga is how Carrie likes to spend her free time when she is not on her bike or skis.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>Human beings are inherently resilient.  Despite what families and individuals have been through before seeking mental health treatment, the outcomes and potential for health, hope, and healing are what keep Carrie coming back to work each day.&nbsp; When people are treated with compassion and respect through the treatment process, families can look back fondly with pride and honor for all that was accomplished.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">SINDI BYERLY, BSN &amp; RN</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">DIRECTOR OF NURSING</h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">CREDENTIALS</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bacherlor of Nursing from West Govenors University</li>



<li>Nursing Licensine from Stevens-Henager College</li>



<li>Currently at South University for Nursing Practitioner with a specialty in Mental Health</li>



<li>In the process of getting a Diabetic Educator License</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PROFESSIONAL</h5>



<p>Nursing has been a passion of Sindi&#8217;s for a very long time. She enjoys working in the mental health field, and it is that field that Sindi has chosen to devote her career to. Sindi received her Bachelor’s Degree in Nursing and is currently pursuing a Nurse Practitioner Degree to further her education and understanding of the field.</p>



<p>Prior to joining the Bridge House team, Sindi worked in the ER at Heritage Park from 2012-2014. From there she moved on to Elevations RTC and Viewpoint Center where she worked from 2014-2021. She was hired as a nurse and was soon promoted to the Director of Nursing, a position that she held from 2015-2021. Before beginning her journey in healthcare, Sindi owned and operated her own printing business from 2000-2010. This gave her an in-depth understanding of what it means to run a business and how to be a good boss and manager.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>Sindi was raised in Eastern Montana on a cattle ranch surrounded for miles by the great outdoors. Her childhood was filled with farm life: growing crops, breaking horses, riding motorcycles, and keeping the ranch running. It wasn’t until she was almost 20 years old that she finally bought meat and eggs from the store. She rode the school bus 12 miles every day on a bus filled with students from Kindergarten to 12<sup>th</sup> grade which made for an entertaining 12-mile ride.</p>



<p>In 1984 she moved to Utah with her eldest daughter. It was here in Utah that she had her second and third daughters, raised the three of them, and took it upon herself to be actively involved in their lives. Sindi found herself wearing many hats during this time. From parent to soccer coach to Girl Scout leader. Sindi was involved in it all.</p>



<p>Now Sindi loves spending time with her husband, daughters, and grandchildren. She still rides motorcycles to this day, fuels her avid love of the outdoors through hiking, camping, and biking, and finds time for herself through crafting and connects with her loved ones through cooking. Chicken piccata is currently her favorite dish to make, and one of the more recent recipes she taught herself. Her home is made that much cozier by the presence of her two Cornish Rex cats, Cam and Kickstand who provide unconditional love and entertainment. Her dream is to one-day own property big enough where she could own horses again, grow a garden big enough to handle more than just tomatoes and squash, and have the whole family over for the holidays.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>To Sindi, Hope, Health and Healing mean more than can be put into words. It means personal growth and confidence. If you have those three things, Sindi believes you can achieve a sense of wholeness. They work together to create a fully realized human being. This can look like independence, self-esteem, and autonomy. Sindi actively incorporates this into her life by keeping an open mind, continuing to educate herself, and maintaining a positive attitude. Hope, Health, and Healing has had a resounding impact on Sindi’s life because she has lived it herself. Being the parent, friend, and sibling to those who have struggled with their mental health has given her a deeper understanding of what it’s like to be on the other side of the table and take that understanding with her as she navigates helping others from the clinical side. Sindi’s goal is to provide more support and understanding for residents and their families because it is her belief that we can have a healthier society through a better support system for mental health. Sindi wants to be a part of that support network to ensure people have resources to help themselves when they are ready.</p>
