<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-theme-primary-color has-text-color">DR. CHRIS MCROBERTS</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">DIRECTOR OF DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES / FOUNDER</h4>



<p></p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">CREDENTIALS</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ph.D. Clinical Psychology, Magna Cum Laude, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah</li>



<li>Bachelor of Psychology and Sociology, Minors in Statistics and Philosophy, Magna Cum Laude, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah</li>



<li>Licensed Clinical Psychologist&nbsp;since 1999</li>



<li>Member of the American Psychological Association since 1999</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PROFESSIONAL</h5>



<p>Dr. Chris McRoberts has been conceptualizing the Bridge House model and the prospect of one day providing a place of hope, health, and healing for over 15 years.  Dr. McRoberts began his mental health career in 1992 as a job coach for intellectually disabled adults.  This and other service experiences sparked his desire to learn about and serve people with mental health problems and cognitive differences.  He subsequently committed his career and energy to help others in need.  Research and evidence-based practices have provided the structure for his studies and work with adults and adolescents.  He loves research and has published several peer-reviewed articles and presented research findings at many national conferences on education and mental health.  During his university studies, Dr. McRoberts took part in internships and practicums that exposed him to a wide range of individuals&#8217; emotional and intellectual challenges.  His doctoral program focused on assessing and treating mental disorders and cognitive differences in both children and adults.</p>



<p>Dr. McRoberts worked at the Utah State Hospital, private practice clinics, acute hospital units, a large community mental health center, and public and private schools leading up to his licensure as a Clinical Psychologist in 1999.  Dr. McRoberts founded and built an assessment-based practice in 1998. He supervised fifteen psychologists specializing in educational, neuropsychological, and psychological evaluation of children, adolescents, and adults in Utah, Idaho, New York, and North Carolina.  Through this process, he traveled throughout the United States and internationally, conducting comprehensive psychological and educational evaluations.  He has visited and examined well over 100 schools and therapeutic programs along the way.  Dr. McRoberts has become a recognized expert and supervisor in psychological and cognitive testing and evaluation.  Dr. McRoberts has been on the founding team developing and/or serving as board president for eight prestigious residential treatment and wilderness therapy programs beginning in 2005.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>Dr. McRoberts lived in Oregon, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, California, Spain, St. Maarten, and Tennessee before finally settling in Utah.  Dr. McRoberts loves to listen and hear people’s stories, and he has the uncanny ability to make people feel comfortable and at ease very quickly.  He despises formal settings and occasions and is most comfortable in his flip-flops.  Dr. McRoberts’ favorite person in this world is his wife, Kristy.  He has a passion for different cultures and seeks opportunities to immerse himself in different societies and learn from other people&#8217;s lives.  Dr. McRoberts prioritizes family, including his children (three sons and a daughter) and grandchildren.  He imparted upon his children his thirst for knowledge and adventure, raising them with travel, service, and physical activity as core foundations, introducing them to the power of giving back through humanitarian projects and travel in Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru, Fiji, Thailand, and Spain.</p>



<p>A traditional office therapy job has never been an option for Dr. McRoberts.  He enjoys helping clients by seeing them in their home environments, spending time with them in treatment settings, and collaborating with their treatment teams.  He is invigorated by the challenge of figuring out learning differences and helping people progress to their potential.  Dr. McRoberts also takes pride in employing the people who work in mental health fields.  Seeing employees and their families grow and learn is one of his greatest joys.  Dr. McRoberts sincerely believes that he can accomplish anything that he sets his mind to, and he loves a challenge.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>Dr. McRoberts was born with congenital cataracts.  His parents were told he would never read, ride a bike, or drive.  They were encouraged to protect him.  Instead, they opted to treat him just as they did their other children.  His dad held faith in the hope that Chris could do so much more than the doctors believed.  He bought Chris a bike when he was five, believing that he might give up if he crashed too often.  Chris persevered.  His parents put no boundaries on his abilities, and subsequently, he learned to work around his limitations in unexpected ways.  Dr. McRoberts sees mental health in the same way.  When people have mental illnesses and cognitive disabilities, the focus should remain on what can be accomplished rather than on limitations.  People with all types of mental and physical disabilities can achieve amazing things if provided the opportunity.  Dr. McRoberts wants to remove the stigma of mental illness while helping people with mental health struggles become their best selves.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DR. KIERA SCHLANSKY<br></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MEDICAL DIRECTOR / PSYCHIATRIST</h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">CREDENTIALS</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bachelor of Arts in Biology, University of San Diego</li>



<li>Creighton University School of Medicine</li>



<li>Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Adult Psychiatry Residency Program</li>



<li>Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry Fellowship&nbsp;</li>



<li>Board Certified by American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PROFESSIONAL</h5>



<p>Dr. Schlansky completed undergraduate studies in biology in San Diego, CA, graduating with honors, and then attended medical school in Omaha, Nebraska.  She pursued adult psychiatric training at Vanderbilt University and completed a two-year child &amp; adolescent sub-specialty fellowship.  Psychiatric training at Vanderbilt offered Dr. Schlansky a wealth of opportunities to work with leaders in the field in treating first-break psychosis and mood disorders, substance use disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders with equal focus on psychopharmacology and psychotherapy.  Dr. Schlansky’s interest in both the interpersonal and biological sequelae of attachment during early life leads to her interest in treating children, adolescents, and transitional age youth and the entire family system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Schlansky is passionate about delivering the best evidence-based psychiatric treatment within a collaborative model with the identified patient and their family.  She believes psychiatric diagnosis should be a collaborative process during which both the physician and the patient develop an understanding of current symptomatology and arrive together at a treatment plan in accordance with the patient’s goals and values. Dr. Schlansky is particularly skilled in treating patients with complex presentations that have previously eluded accurate understanding or effective treatment.  Her extensive focus on family therapy during training allows for a deep understanding of the dynamic and genetic factors that may have contributed to a patient’s current presentation.  Her warm, compassionate, and friendly communication style allows for patients and families to feel heard and supported throughout the treatment process.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>Dr. Schlansky lives on a small hobby farm in Utah which she shares with her husband, six goats, a flock of chickens, two pigs, two rabbits, and one very spoiled chihuahua.  When she’s not working on the farm, she enjoys practicing yoga (sometimes with goats), climbing, stand-up paddleboarding, and painting in her home studio.  Her interest in art has expanded into her psychiatric practice in recent years, developing therapeutic art practices for patients to cultivate their creativity and experience the freedom of personal expression.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>Both conceptually and scientifically, mental health treatment has changed considerably in the recent past, and Dr. Schlansky believes that Bridge House’s treatment philosophy represents the next phase in this evolution.  Bridge House offers mental health care in a manner and environment that encourages patients to take their first steps in their personal healing journey and inspires hope for a future on the other side of treatment. We believe that aligning with our patients in this process facilitates movement toward our shared goal of long-lasting health.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">SINDI BYERLY, BSN &amp; RN</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">DIRECTOR OF NURSING</h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">CREDENTIALS</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bacherlor of Nursing from West Govenors University</li>



<li>Nursing Licensine from Stevens-Henager College</li>



<li>Currently at South University for Nursing Practitioner with a specialty in Mental Health</li>



<li>In the process of getting a Diabetic Educator License</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PROFESSIONAL</h5>



<p>Nursing has been a passion of Sindi&#8217;s for a very long time. She enjoys working in the mental health field, and it is that field that Sindi has chosen to devote her career to. Sindi received her Bachelor’s Degree in Nursing and is currently pursuing a Nurse Practitioner Degree to further her education and understanding of the field.</p>



<p>Prior to joining the Bridge House team, Sindi worked in the ER at Heritage Park from 2012-2014. From there she moved on to Elevations RTC and Viewpoint Center where she worked from 2014-2021. She was hired as a nurse and was soon promoted to the Director of Nursing, a position that she held from 2015-2021. Before beginning her journey in healthcare, Sindi owned and operated her own printing business from 2000-2010. This gave her an in-depth understanding of what it means to run a business and how to be a good boss and manager.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>Sindi was raised in Eastern Montana on a cattle ranch surrounded for miles by the great outdoors. Her childhood was filled with farm life: growing crops, breaking horses, riding motorcycles, and keeping the ranch running. It wasn’t until she was almost 20 years old that she finally bought meat and eggs from the store. She rode the school bus 12 miles every day on a bus filled with students from Kindergarten to 12<sup>th</sup> grade which made for an entertaining 12-mile ride.</p>



<p>In 1984 she moved to Utah with her eldest daughter. It was here in Utah that she had her second and third daughters, raised the three of them, and took it upon herself to be actively involved in their lives. Sindi found herself wearing many hats during this time. From parent to soccer coach to Girl Scout leader. Sindi was involved in it all.</p>



<p>Now Sindi loves spending time with her husband, daughters, and grandchildren. She still rides motorcycles to this day, fuels her avid love of the outdoors through hiking, camping, and biking, and finds time for herself through crafting and connects with her loved ones through cooking. Chicken piccata is currently her favorite dish to make, and one of the more recent recipes she taught herself. Her home is made that much cozier by the presence of her two Cornish Rex cats, Cam and Kickstand who provide unconditional love and entertainment. Her dream is to one-day own property big enough where she could own horses again, grow a garden big enough to handle more than just tomatoes and squash, and have the whole family over for the holidays.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>To Sindi, Hope, Health and Healing mean more than can be put into words. It means personal growth and confidence. If you have those three things, Sindi believes you can achieve a sense of wholeness. They work together to create a fully realized human being. This can look like independence, self-esteem, and autonomy. Sindi actively incorporates this into her life by keeping an open mind, continuing to educate herself, and maintaining a positive attitude. Hope, Health, and Healing has had a resounding impact on Sindi’s life because she has lived it herself. Being the parent, friend, and sibling to those who have struggled with their mental health has given her a deeper understanding of what it’s like to be on the other side of the table and take that understanding with her as she navigates helping others from the clinical side. Sindi’s goal is to provide more support and understanding for residents and their families because it is her belief that we can have a healthier society through a better support system for mental health. Sindi wants to be a part of that support network to ensure people have resources to help themselves when they are ready.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">BROOKE BOUWHUIS, RDN, CD</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">CLINICAL DIETITIAN</h4>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">CREDENTIALS</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Registered Dietitian Nutritionist &amp; Certified Dietitian, Utah State University, Logan, Utah</li>



<li>Registration and Certification, American Dietetic Association</li>



<li>Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Food Science, Medical Dietetics emphasis; Psychology minor, Utah State University, Logan, Utah</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PROFESSIONAL</h5>



<p>Brooke began her career as a dietitian in the dietary supplement industry.  Having worked in that industry for over 16 years, Brooke has a strong knowledge of the power of supplementation.  She believes that while some supplements can be beneficial, they are not all as revolutionary as we may be led to believe. When the next phase of her career opened, Brooke began&nbsp;creating weight loss menu plans for bloggers and currently works in the wellness industry for a local fitness camp that draws clients worldwide.  Brooke also has one nationally recognized weight management certification from the American Dietetic Association.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brooke loves people and is passionate about helping them heal using the power of food.  Her philosophy on nutrition is firmly on the functional nutrition side of the plate.  The functional power of food that informs her dietetic practice also showed up in her personal life, when Brooke helped her teenage daughter heal from a battle with&nbsp;<em>clostridium difficile</em>&nbsp;<em>colitis</em>.  When this health challenge left Brooke’s daughter with post-infectious IBS, she quickly realized that a handful of medications were not the solution to helping her daughter heal and thrive.  Ultimately, Brooke and her daughter found a food-centered solution by eliminating several triggering foods from her diet.  This solution has kept her daughter not only symptom-free but also medication-free.  From both personal and professional experience, Brooke understands the strong connections between gut health and mental health, and she is constantly advocating this message.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">PERSONAL</h5>



<p>Brooke can be found on her mountain bike or fat bike, tearing up the trails if not at a track meet or soccer game for her kids.  If there is light still left in the day, Brooke can be found putting around in her organic garden, listening to podcasts, or reading books about health and wellness.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING</h5>



<p>Brooke believes that hope, healing and health come as individually tailored solutions.  She knows that each resident comes to Bridge House with varied life challenges and needs that make them unique.  Brooke helps them navigate their path to wellness by approaching them from a place of love, patience, and empathy.</p>
