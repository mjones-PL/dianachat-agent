<p><strong>“When you fuel your body properly, you heal your body. When you heal your body, you heal your brain. When you heal your brain, you heal your mind.” &#8211; Brooke Bouwhuis, RDN, CD.</strong></p>



<p>At Bridge House, we know that healing is a whole-body process.&nbsp; We can not expect our residents to start feeling better unless we address all elements of their emotional, physical and spiritual needs.&nbsp; Nutrition is of utmost importance to our people as they move forward in their lives.&nbsp; Through a combination of individualized counseling and consultation with our Clinical Dietitian, psycho-educational groups offered weekly, and a thoughtful approach to menu planning, we can help our residents learn about how food fuels their healing process.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sample-Meal-Snack-Menu-791x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1515" width="359" height="464" srcset="https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sample-Meal-Snack-Menu-791x1024.png 791w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sample-Meal-Snack-Menu-232x300.png 232w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sample-Meal-Snack-Menu-768x994.png 768w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sample-Meal-Snack-Menu-1187x1536.png 1187w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sample-Meal-Snack-Menu-1583x2048.png 1583w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></figure></div>



<p class="has-text-align-left">In her weekly Nutrition group, Brooke Bouwhuis, Bridge House’s Clinical Dietician, teaches our residents about their gut microbiome and their immune system. 90% of our serotonin is made in our gut, so eating healthy is really where it all starts, she shares.&nbsp; When our residents are educated on their immune system and gut microbiome they are able to understand how important it is to eat whole real food and begin to connect their physical health and healing with their mental health journey. &nbsp; Brooke’s groups usually incorporate something tangible to touch, taste, and talk about.&nbsp; With those tangibles, we will do a lot of label-reading.&nbsp; We may taste and label-read a variety of chocolates, from Hershey’s chocolate to single-source organic chocolates.&nbsp; We try varieties of yogurts, kombucha, and foods from other cultures. Often residents are involved in hands-on activities with Brooke to help them learn new cooking techniques, recipes, and menu/meal planning&nbsp; Her goal is to help residents expand their tastebuds and interest.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Brooke teaches residents about snack foods from the grocery store “that won’t kill you” in her words.&nbsp; It’s a challenge for all of us to walk into a store and avoid foods that are bad for us because the labels are designed to draw us in.&nbsp; The snack food industry is a billion-dollar industry, making it really hard to compete against.&nbsp; We strive to help our residents understand healthier snack substitutes so they are able to make educated decisions while grocery shopping. Some residents may lack the skills and knowledge to prepare meals and make healthy choices.&nbsp; Others have come to us from places where they had little to no control over what they could eat.&nbsp; We aim to build on their skill-set and plant seeds of knowledge while shifting their whole mindset to <strong>“How do I improve my whole-body health?”</strong>&nbsp; Food is just one of the cogs on the wheel of healthy life.&nbsp; Every bite we take influences what happens in our gut, and subsequently, what happens in our mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FullSizeRender-8-2-1024x861.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1535" width="373" height="313" srcset="https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FullSizeRender-8-2-1024x861.jpg 1024w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FullSizeRender-8-2-300x252.jpg 300w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FullSizeRender-8-2-768x646.jpg 768w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FullSizeRender-8-2-1536x1292.jpg 1536w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FullSizeRender-8-2-70x60.jpg 70w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FullSizeRender-8-2.jpg 2013w" sizes="(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px" /></figure></div>



<p>Brooke collaborates with our two full-time Chefs in meal planning and supporting individualized dietary plans based on a whole-foods approach.&nbsp; Our meals are prepared fresh, onsite, and from scratch three meals a day.&nbsp; The culinary team runs two 6-week seasonal menus for fall/winter, and spring/summer.&nbsp; The meals are designed to easily accommodate gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, or kosher needs as well as other allergies or intolerances.&nbsp; They are given foods that are steamed, roasted, grilled, baked, and raw, to expose them to all types of preparations.&nbsp; We strive to fill their plates with as many different colored foods that are fresh, delicious, nutritious, and healing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The terms neuropsychological, psychological, and psychiatric evaluations are often misused in the mental health field, often even by mental health professionals.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Many people believe that any evaluation that includes cognitive testing is a neuropsychological evaluation.&nbsp; This is not the case. Some professionals, including therapists, may use these terms interchangeably.&nbsp; Our goal in this article is to help clarify the differences between a neuropsychological evaluation, a psychological evaluation, and a psychiatric evaluation and how each can achieve a different goal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The three types of evaluations we will discuss are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Psychiatric Evaluation</strong>: An MD psychiatrist conducts a psychiatric evaluation, assesses psychiatric disorders, and prescribes appropriate therapeutic modalities and medications.</li><li><strong>Psychological Evaluation</strong>: Conducted by a Ph.D. Psychologist, a psychological evaluation focuses on diagnosing mental health and cognitive disorders.</li><li><strong>Neuropsychological Evaluation:</strong>  Conducted by a Ph.D. Neuropsychologist who has a specialization in neuropsychology.  Neuropsychologists specialize in understanding discrete aspects of brain functioning.  </li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-Photo-Angle-View-1-scaled-e1627406171812-1024x691.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1265" width="623" height="420" srcset="https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-Photo-Angle-View-1-scaled-e1627406171812-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-Photo-Angle-View-1-scaled-e1627406171812-300x202.jpg 300w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-Photo-Angle-View-1-scaled-e1627406171812-768x518.jpg 768w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-Photo-Angle-View-1-scaled-e1627406171812-1536x1036.jpg 1536w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-Photo-Angle-View-1-scaled-e1627406171812-2048x1381.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Psychiatric Evaluation</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>A typical psychiatric evaluation is about 60 minutes long, and it includes the psychiatrist interviewing the patient and asking a series of structured and unstructured questions. In layman’s terms, the psychiatric evaluation primarily focuses on medication management.&nbsp; At Bridge House, our approach to the psychiatric evaluation varies substantially depending on the client’s needs, and we often spend considerably more time gathering the information required for the evaluation.&nbsp; <strong>The goal is to gather enough information about a resident’s background and symptoms to formulate an initial diagnostic impression and to be able to proceed with medication management.&nbsp;</strong> At Bridge House, that might mean changing medication doses, discontinuing medications, and/or starting new medications that are more appropriate.&nbsp; Psychiatrists have training in therapy and medication management, and at Bridge House, our psychiatrists are more involved in the therapeutic process than generally any other mental health setting. By being involved in a resident’s therapeutic process, the psychiatrist can include information in the evaluation gathered during these interactions.&nbsp; This, among other sources of information, helps us complete a full diagnostic picture far beyond determining the need for integrating medications.</p>



<p><strong>Psychological Evaluation</strong></p>



<p>A psychological evaluation is a comprehensive background and history assessment that includes everything in a client’s life and history, starting from pregnancy and early development.&nbsp; It includes family, social, and medical history, substance use history, and many other aspects of the client’s life.&nbsp; <strong>A psychological evaluation will consist of personality testing to understand how the client navigates through the world and relationships.</strong>&nbsp; It will give insight into issues related to mental illness and can create an understanding of the client’s coping skills and social skills.&nbsp; Cognitive testing is focused on understanding the client’s intellectual level, strengths, weaknesses, thinking, and reasoning in general. This type of evaluation will result in a 20 to 40-page write-up of the history, test results, and a formal diagnosis based on those results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Bridge House, the Psychological Evaluation summarizes all that we have learned about a resident in their time at Bridge House.&nbsp; Contrasting the 4-8 hours spent in typical outpatient or hospital settings on a psychological evaluation, our team of Psychologists meets with the treatment teams of each resident weekly over the course of several months, and they spend multiple days for several weeks conducting interviews and administering batteries directly with our residents.&nbsp; A relationship is formed, and trust is built through this process.&nbsp; Information will include insights collected from the psychiatrist, the therapist, and the Bridge House residential staff.&nbsp; We want to gather as many sources of information as we can for a thorough evaluation.&nbsp; The psychological evaluation at Bridge House will come with recommendations for treatment, level of care, academic support, family therapy recommendations, and if needed, substance abuse treatment, and much more.&nbsp; The time spent building a relationship and a true understanding allows for the Bridge House team to accurately identify what is going on, and why, and most importantly, what to do about it next.&nbsp; We can present this information to our residents from a place of trust and rapport, resulting in greater integration of this information into the lives of our residents far beyond discharge from Bridge House. &nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ihfopazzjhm-scaled-e1621617657466-1024x1024.jpg" alt="human brain toy" class="wp-image-448" width="440" height="440" srcset="https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ihfopazzjhm-scaled-e1621617657466-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ihfopazzjhm-scaled-e1621617657466-300x300.jpg 300w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ihfopazzjhm-scaled-e1621617657466-150x150.jpg 150w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ihfopazzjhm-scaled-e1621617657466-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ihfopazzjhm-scaled-e1621617657466-600x600.jpg 600w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ihfopazzjhm-scaled-e1621617657466.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Neuropsychological Evaluation</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A neuropsychological evaluation is geared towards understanding deficits in brain functioning beyond what might be found in a psychological evaluation.</strong>&nbsp; These deficits may have been caused by birth trauma, substance abuse, concussions, head traumas, genetic anomalies, genetic disorders, or other insults to the brain that need to be better understood.&nbsp; A client’s history might point to a need for a neuropsychological evaluation, but most often, the psychological evaluation would point out the need for further testing of this type.&nbsp; This can include speech problems, movement problems, hearing or vision differences, visual and spatial differences, and executive functioning that are beyond what psychological evaluations look at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Neuropsychological evaluation might include tests such as an MRI, CT scan, or other different brain functioning tests.&nbsp; Bridge House does not conduct neuropsychological evaluations onsite because it requires specific medical equipment and a specific professional to complete the assessment.&nbsp; If we find that a current client needs this type of specialty test, we will not hesitate to outsource this need to a local neuropsychologist to ensure that we are getting the full picture and leaving no stone unturned. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For many of our residents, completing the Bridge House process is the first thing they have successfully completed in a very long time.&nbsp; We recognize this, and we celebrate this accomplishment.&nbsp; The Bridge Ceremony has been a tradition for our residents since we opened our doors in 2017. It is a way for us to honor progress and hard work, and for our community to express our well-wishes for residents as they prepare to move forward in their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BABFB641-00F0-4A97-8698-93B61E7402B2_1_201_a-861x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-1386" width="396" height="462"/></figure></div>



<p>If you have ever visited Bridge House, you may have noticed a beautiful array of painted rocks surrounding the creekbed that runs through campus.&nbsp; As residents prepare to move on to their next steps, they will pick out a rock from the property and set it in the art studio.&nbsp; Fellow residents and staff will paint on the rock over the course of the week leading up to the resident’s departure from Bridge House.&nbsp; Inside jokes, well-wishes, kind messages, and other expressions of care and compassion will be decorated on the rock, creating a collage of memories and images unique to each person who has spent time with us.</p>



<p>The Bridge Ceremony is typically scheduled the day of or the day before a resident’s departure.&nbsp; The entire Bridge House community is invited to each ceremony, and it is not uncommon for employees to be present even when a ceremony falls on their day off.&nbsp; All participants will sit in a circle, signifying unity and equality. All are given an opportunity to explain what they painted on the rock and share any specific well-wishes for the resident. After everyone has had a chance to speak, the group will move out to the courtyard.&nbsp; The departing resident will stand on the bridge with their rock. They will be encouraged to share about their time at Bridge House and will often express gratitude to those who have helped and supported them during this journey. They then place their rock in the creek bed or the courtyard, creating a lasting legacy of their time with us, and signifying their accomplishments.&nbsp; These rocks serve as a reminder to other residents of all who have walked across this bridge before them.</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><meta charset="utf-8">Bridge House offers me a unique opportunity to support others in their healing journey; through yoga and massage.   <meta charset="utf-8">Working here allows for a unique relationship-based connection with the residents. I have the opportunity to get to know the individual, I know their struggles, and I see them through their ups and downs.&nbsp; At Bridge House, I get to work with all our residents every week, and it’s a privilege to get to know everyone and watch them heal.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sumsion-IMG_P-0772-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Sarah Wiser" class="wp-image-164" width="397" height="397" srcset="https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sumsion-IMG_P-0772-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sumsion-IMG_P-0772-300x300.jpg 300w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sumsion-IMG_P-0772-150x150.jpg 150w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sumsion-IMG_P-0772-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sumsion-IMG_P-0772-600x600.jpg 600w, https://bridgehousehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sumsion-IMG_P-0772.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p><strong><meta charset="utf-8"></strong>I have the opportunity to lead three yoga classes a week for our residents, and I offer weekly massage therapy sessions for each resident.&nbsp; I have been a licensed massage therapist since 1996, and I received my yoga certification in 2010. Yoga and massage complement each other and achieve maximum benefit with collaborative practice. I assist residents by strengthening their core and improving sore or weak muscle groups through poses, stretching, and massage. I also introduce a meditative element to sessions. Consistency is key to any healing process. We achieve a peaceful state of mind, a happy outlook, and a strong body through consistent practice.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Massage can release energy from your body that you don&#8217;t realize you are holding.</strong>&nbsp; Our residents are encouraged to learn about the connection between their brain and their body.&nbsp; “Where am I holding something?&nbsp; How do I let it go?”&nbsp; Reminding them to breathe during a massage and encouraging them to slow their breathing is part of the meditative experience.&nbsp; We need human and physical touch in our lives. Avoiding touch and movement is a common defense mechanism for people.&nbsp; Understanding this is the first step to breaking down these barriers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">At Bridge House, it is common to see residents who are quite resistant and fearful of touch in some cases.&nbsp; When working with these individuals, I have to realize that every person who comes through our door seeks a safe space. I must develop a relationship first to provide that safe space. I do an initial assessment with each resident called the Mind, Body Spirit assessment.&nbsp; I am seeking to understand each individual’s relationship with their own body and with their mind. It is common in these assessments that I am told, “I don&#8217;t like yoga,” “I can’t relax during the massage,” “Meditation is frightening for me.” In an effort to create a safe space for them, I do what I can to be a part of their lives while they are at Bridge House. I will continue to express my genuine interest in them, get to know them, and build a relationship that way. This builds trust, and relationship, the premise upon which everything is based at Bridge House.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">I teach an experiential group on Saturdays. In this group, we cook, garden, and learn new things together. I can connect with individuals in these different settings.&nbsp; I can create trust with those who may not be otherwise receptive to the yoga and massage offerings. <strong>In the gardening group, we can see the beauty and growth of putting a seed in the ground and taking care of it.&nbsp; This can draw many parallels to the Bridge House process and health and healing. If you put time, work, and focused energy into doing, you will see those same results.</strong> It&#8217;s rewarding to work with people who may be going through some of the most challenging times of their lives and be able to bring them some element of peace and calm.</p>

<p>As many of our families and fellow mental health professionals know, it can present a challenge to effectively manage medications in clinical situations where a diagnosis may be yet unknown or complicated.  Traditional psychiatric prescribing practices are guided by diagnosis.  At Bridge House, the entire experience is orientated around determining an accurate diagnosis.  Therefore a unique approach to managing medications is required. </p>



<p>Medications have indications for treating sets of symptoms associated with psychiatric diagnoses.  Our goal is to make as few medication changes as possible in the initial week of treatment, barring any immediately dangerous or absolute contraindications.  This is intentional as we get to know the resident and also helps provide diagnostic information.  We can see meanings and attachments residents have placed on their medication regimens, not all of which are accurate or beneficial for them.  <strong>We utilize pharmacogenetic testing to help guide but not replace our clinical judgment.</strong>  We have found this useful for people who have had multiple medication trials and have either had side effects or poor efficacy.  We also have found this testing to help engage the resident in a greater understanding of how medications work.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>We use a collaborative decision-making model with residents when deciding on medication strategies.</strong>  Our goal is to help residents better understand how medications fit into their overall treatment plan.&nbsp; Instead of choosing a medication for a patient in the usual prescriptive manner, residents are invited to participate in our clinical decision-making process, which is more typically behind the scenes and only discussed among providers.  Our approach involves assisting residents in evaluating risk/benefit profiles of several medication strategies appropriate for them and deciding collaboratively on what works best for them.  Face-to-face weekly contact with the resident and their prescriber assists in empowering people to take the reigns of their own care and engage in the process in a meaningful way.  Bridge House providers are full-time employees and members of the integrative treatment team.  They can make recommendations from a place of relationship and understanding.  The collaborative decision-making model empowers the resident with greater knowledge and self-awareness and helps build a sense of partnership toward the residents’ individual treatment goals.  The model also provides a framework for addressing differences of opinion between doctor and patient respectfully and productively.</p>



<p>It can be common for a resident to enroll with pre-existing prescriptions for medications that might have relative contraindications or unfavorable risk/benefit ratios.  These are typically controlled substances such as stimulants or sedatives/hypnotics.  Our first response is not to immediately discontinue these medications unless it is dangerous.  In our experience, we achieve better long-term success and better overall medication understanding and adherence when we allow the resident to realize that there are medications that help them get closer to their goals and medications that feel reassuring but are ultimately in contrast with their values.  If this realization is not reached during a residents&#8217; time at Bridge House, instructions for continued tapering may be given at the next steps, or the medication may be safely discontinued if we have reason to believe the resident will not be compliant with a controlled taper.  Residents will not leave Bridge House on unsafe or unsustainable medication regimens.  <strong>It is our hope and has been our experience that taking this approach produces improved long-term outcomes and a sustained commitment to health and well-being. </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Families come to Bridge House because they have questions about: What&#8217;s occurring for their loved one, Why it&#8217;s occurring, and most importantly, What to do about it.  We operate from the idea that humans have an inherent desire for wellness, and when you hold space and get out of their way, they will move towards it.  When you try to fix things for them, you try to change them, and when you try to take their struggle away, you are communicating that they are not capable.  We know that success in a residential setting doesn’t always correlate to success beyond.  How do we know that the Bridge House model of assessment and treatment actually works?  How do we measure our outcomes?   Some measurable factors allow us to understand the effect that we can have on our residents and their families.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Program Completion:</strong> We know that people cannot make change if there is no dissonance.  If there is not a sense of conflict, people are not going to start trying new ways of thinking, new ways of acting, new ways of being, new ways of seeing themselves.  This process can be uncomfortable.  That discomfort is necessary and we don&#8217;t want to eliminate the struggle or tell them they shouldn&#8217;t be struggling.  No change is going to take place without it.  Getting people through our doors for enrollment is one thing, but engaging with them in a way that allows them to feel safe, heard and cared about, on those days when the discomfort is at it’s pinnacle, is another task altogether.  Many of the people we serve at Bridge House have had multiple experiences with mental health professionals and treatment settings that have not ended well.  Our people tend to be defended and hesitant to trust.  We know we must create a different outcome and we must create rapport and relationship from day one, so that we can allow our residents to see this process through to the end.  <br><br>When looking at difficult elements of one’s own life story, or when surrendering access to mal-adative coping mechanisms, life can feel uncomfortable.  Humans inherently try to avoid discomfort. For most of our residents, when this struggle is present, they will think about leaving Bridge House, they might talk about leaving Bridge House, and some of them might actually choose to leave the program.   <br><br>For our Team, a worst-case outcome is when someone leaves the program against medical advice.  We work tirelessly to establish a genuine connection with each individual who comes through our doors.  And it works.  <strong>94% of residents who enroll with us will complete the Bridge House program.   </strong>Considering that nearly everybody thinks about leaving, talks about leaving or actually chooses to leave for a period of time, we find that the relationships that we have built with our residents allows them to feel cared about here.  For those who choose to leave the program, within a matter of hours or sometimes days, they are able to recognize that they have felt seen and heard, and they will come back to engage in the Bridge House process with us.  We know that if we can tap into each individual’s inherent desire for connectivity and wellness, we can together create a different outcome.  At their core, our people want to feel better.  </li></ol>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"><li><strong>What Comes after Bridge House:  </strong>All of our people will need continued support in one form or another once they leave Bridge House.  When residents enter Bridge House they typically are resistant to considering that there may be a long road ahead.  About two thirds of the way through a resident’s time with us, we sit down with them and with their treatment team to review all that we have learned about them in our time together.  In addition to discussing their diagnosis, we spend time outlining their support plan, and our recommendations for services following Bridge House.  By this point in the process, our people are able to hear these recommendations as coming from a place of trust and relationship.  Our recommendations will mean nothing if our people do not feel seen and understood in this process.  It’s common for residents to remark that “finally someone gets me.”  Often with tears in their eyes, they wonder “why didn&#8217;t someone ever tell me this before?”.   It can be a very powerful experience.  What they, and their families, are feeling at that moment, is hope. Hope for a different outcome.  Hope that their life can be different with this new understanding of their own capacity, and how their brain functions.  <strong>94% of our people completing the program, are able to accept the recommendations presented to them in this meeting and agree to continue on the road to health and healing. </strong></li></ol>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"><li><strong>Follow up:  </strong>Bridge House was established on the belief that the mental health system in our country is broken.  If we cannot get our people to the right level of care post Bridge House then we have further contributed to this broken system.  It matters nothing what we do here if it cannot be generalized out in the world.  We put a tremendous amount of energy into finding the level of support that fits the needs of each of our residents.  It is a very individualized process taking into account all elements of support that one might need, including but not limited to: therapeutic needs, psychiatric needs, medical needs, social needs, emotional needs, spiritual needs, recreational needs and nutritional needs. Following discharge, our team contacts the care providers who are working with our people and we ask if our people were prepared.  We want to learn what their regression looked like, and if they landed in the right level of care, based on our recommendations.  <strong>To the extent where these pieces of feedback are objective and measurable, we have found that 84% of our people, and their care teams, would report that our recommendations were on target for support post Bridge House.</strong></li></ol>



<p>In short, what success looks like, can vary from person to person.  We hope that our people can believe that it is possible to have a different outcome.  They can start feeling better about themselves and start believing that it&#8217;s possible to live a life of independence that is meaningful and that they can be proud of. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over decades of his career, it became clear to Bridge House founder Dr. Chris McRoberts that most people with mental health, cognitive, learning, substance abuse, and behavioral difficulties were not adequately assessed or accurately diagnosed before beginning costly and time-consuming therapeutic regimens.&nbsp; It became clear that a slower, comprehensive, integrative, and community-based assessment strategy should be implemented.  This is how the Bridge House model came to be.</p>



<p>It is a plan that developed over a period of nearly two decades.  This plan began when Dr. Chris McRoberts created psychological testing and evaluation firm with psychologists specializing in evaluating children, adolescents, and young adults in schools, therapeutic programs, and private practice settings around the United States and even internationally.&nbsp; Dr. McRoberts found that many people were being tested during times of crisis or while in a hospital when test results could be erroneous.  Additionally, many people underwent psychological, educational, or neuropsychological testing when experiencing the lasting effects of drugs or alcohol or immediately after significant medication changes that might impact their test results.  Some were evaluated in the midst of a severe psychotic, manic, or depressive phase of their illness. Others had physical illnesses, chromosomal abnormalities, dietary problems, family situations, or histories of trauma that could cloud test results and lead to inaccurate diagnoses.</p>



<p><strong>RESEARCH EVIDENCE</strong></p>



<p>In 2016 Dr. McRoberts partnered with Rod Andrus, a skilled clinician, and manager with more than 20 years of experience creating and implementing therapeutic programming in residential settings.  Together, they developed a strategy for working with a diverse array of people experiencing mental health and adjustment problems to understand the complex underlying reasons for the struggles people were experiencing.  They utilized research evidence showing that people in acute and chronic distress must experience a caring and nurturing environment with their caregivers to feel safe and secure enough to make therapeutic gains.&nbsp; The assessment program they developed at Bridge House focuses on this environment while also providing structures to keep residents safe. In contrast, they develop stability and, with it, the ability to heal.  As this program is implemented, medications are adjusted. Residents undergo medical, dietary, occupational therapy, DNA, and other comprehensive assessments before making efforts to diagnose and understand their problems accurately.</p>



<p><strong>DIAGNOSIS</strong></p>



<p>Mr. Andrus and Dr. McRoberts also determined that a necessary component of the assessment process was to effectively communicate assessment results to each resident, their families, and future treatment providers so that a plan could be developed for lifelong health and healing.&nbsp; <strong>Because it often takes some time for people to understand the complexity of their issues, an integral part of the Bridge House process is helping each individual understand their diagnosis and the types of supports and therapeutic interventions they will need to</strong> function optimally in society.&nbsp; To this end, each individual at Bridge House participates in a wide variety of community activities for their ability to function outside of residential treatment to be evaluated, and plans can include interventions tailored to their reactions to real-life experiences and challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>HEALING</strong></p>



<p>It was also clear that people could make a significant change during the assessment process developed at Bridge House when the framework for care comes from seeking to understand an individual and their life experiences rather than immediately trying to fix, or solve a problem .  This is accomplished through a wide variety of therapeutic interventions, including eight hours a day of various forms of group therapy made available to residents, intensive individual therapy, and effective medication management.  These interventions have consistently enabled Bridge House residents to make tremendous gains, which in turn, allow them to transition to the least restrictive level of care possible.</p>



<p>At Bridge House, a fundamental tenet backed by many years of research is that&nbsp;<strong>caring relationships heal</strong>.  Because of this, we hire the kindest, compassionate, and caring people we can find who can set good limits and boundaries.  This contributes tremendously to the healing process and creates an environment of peace, safety, and security. Our residents feel secure enough to try new behaviors and risk their deepest selves to make a change.</p>



<p>Finally, the environment at Bridge House was chosen specifically for the peace and calm it engenders.  Our beautiful home sits on five acres with a serene pond, outdoor living spaces, grassy areas, and beautiful trees away from the hubbub of city life.  Our residents are free to move around the property and, when they are safe to do so, can regularly go off the property to engage in service, athletic, and community activities.</p>



<p>We are trying something new at Bridge House, and it’s working to reduce the revolving door that so many people with mental health problems go through with multiple therapists, hospitalizations, medications, and other interventions that were ineffective due to an inaccurate diagnosis and a lack of understanding of each complex individual.&nbsp; <strong>We work hard at Bridge House to develop understanding, create effective interventions, and communicate our understanding of each resident and benefit them long-term.</strong></p>

<p class="has-large-font-size">The Bridge House process incorporates a holistic approach to stabilization with the best sophisticated, comprehensive assessment elements while integrating the cornerstones of compassionate, relationship-based therapy and treatment.  We have set out to re-vision the concept of assessment and diagnostic services available to clients around the country and the world.  Read on for an interview about this Hybrid Approach with Carrie Thompson, Director of Admissions and Business Development.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Within the continuum of mental health care that is available today, what are my options?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> When a person is experiencing a mental health crisis or struggling with chronic mental illness, they are often referred to some form of mental health treatment.  While much mental health and behavioral health services provide “treatment” in the overarching sense that mental health concerns are being addressed, the distinctions between services provided along the continuum of care are helpful to understand.<br>We must first define and discuss some terms.  In general, mental health care falls into three distinct categories: stabilization, assessment, and treatment.  This can be confusing because we often use the word “treatment” as an umbrella term to refer to mental healthcare.<br>It’s helpful to clarify that stabilization services are usually accessed within medical model hospitals.  Stabilization can include everything from addressing an acute mental health crisis in a psychiatric hospital, managing medication through the oversight and care of a psychiatrist, and/or detoxing someone from substance abuse.  The primary goal of stabilization is to get someone from a more acute state to a space where they can engage in a therapeutic process.  Stabilization is typically a short-term attempt to address a situation.<br>Assessment can oftentimes be coupled with stabilization or can be found as a stand-alone service.  The primary goal of mental health assessment is to clarify diagnostically what is occurring for an individual.  An out-patient psychologist or a team at a psychiatric hospital can typically test batteries and come up with a diagnostic conclusion.  While appropriate for more simple cases or high-functioning individuals, this approach can often miss the secondary goal of truly understanding someone’s level of functioning beyond just a diagnosis or outside the hospital walls.<br>Finally, “treatment” is what people are typically referring to when they talk about longer-term care.  Treatment, which is usually informed by some assessment, is accessed in various settings, including residential treatment centers, intensive outpatient programs, transitional living programs, and outpatient therapy.  Individual therapy, group therapy, and family therapy are implemented in these settings and typically follow a particular approach or modality.  Treatment without a preceding thorough assessment to drive the treatment planning approach can at best be time-consuming, and at worst, be contra-indicated. <br><br>Q: So, in general, there’s stabilization, assessment, and treatment. What category is Bridge House in?<br>A: Bridge House holds an interesting spot on the continuum of mental health services and is a unique hybrid of all three models.  The Bridge House process incorporates a holistic approach to stabilization with the best sophisticated, comprehensive assessment elements while integrating the cornerstones of compassionate, relationship-based therapy and treatment.  We have set out to re-vision the concept of assessment and diagnostic services available to clients around the country and the world.  By slowing down the assessment process, a broad understanding is gained.  Our professionals can observe how individuals operate and function in times of crisis or restrictive settings but can watch residents grow, evolve and heal, all guiding a better understanding of a person. </p>

<p><strong>Q: How do you incorporate all of these goals, and how do you prioritize each? </strong><br><strong>A: </strong>Let’s first discuss stabilization.  We know that we can not provide adequate care or accurate assessment if someone is in the throes of a crisis. When people arrive at Bridge House, we provide a safe, home-like, and welcoming environment conducive to their stabilization process. This is especially helpful if they are experiencing an acute mental health crisis.  We aim to connect and create trust and rapport with our residents from day one to help them understand that we are here to help them answer questions and create a road map for their future.  We focus on empowerment and relationship-building to guide this process.  Stepping well beyond the goals of in-patient hospitalization, stabilization at Bridge House incorporates diet, nutrition, sleep, medication, exercise, and mindfulness.  Bridge House has a psychiatrist on-site who manages each resident’s medication regimen to aid with their stabilization process.  Stabilization extends throughout someone’s time with us as we raise their baseline of functioning and engage in a healing process.  Then, in terms of assessment, we have taken the traditional approach to psychological assessment and evaluation and expanded it to include observations of someone’s daily life and behavioral patterns as they live with us in a residential setting.  We refer to this as the milieu assessment, and the information learned through this process is far more valuable than any person’s response to a psychological battery.  A resident’s capacity is assessed on both their good days and their bad days, and cycles and patterns can be observed in real-time, outside of an office or hospital walls.  Assessment and diagnostic services begin truly on day one as we learn about what it means to be human for each of our residents.  Bridge House psychologists have the benefit of completing a wide array of formal assessments (personality, projective, social history, occupational therapy, IQ, achievement, etc.) over the course of weeks, not days, as they can constantly adapt the measures used to answer the unique questions that exist for every one of our clients.  By slowing down the assessment process, a holistic and broad understanding is gained.  In addition to stabilization and assessment, Bridge House also provides treatment for the challenges a resident may be experiencing.  Over the course of care in a safe and supportive environment, Bridge House residents are exposed to various treatment modalities to begin the healing process and determine the most appropriate individualized approach.  While residents are learning about themselves through an integrated assessment process, they simultaneously raise their baseline and level of functioning.  At the end of their stay, residents leave Bridge House with a much better understanding of themselves and what kind of support they will continue to need in the future.  Individual, group, family, and experiential therapy is accessible to all residents throughout their entire stay at Bridge House. The emphasis adapts and changes as we learn more about each individual. <br><br>Q: I’ve heard of treatment programs that complete an assessment at the beginning of a client’s stay with them. How is that assessment different from what Bridge House is providing?<br>A: It’s true, some treatment programs may integrate some cursory assessment at the outset of a client’s treatment experience, but it is typically not the most comprehensive assessment available.  Everything at Bridge House that occurs sits under the umbrella of assessment as we try to understand an individual, what their strengths and challenges might be, and how to best support them in redirecting the trajectory of their lives.  Self-awareness and understanding go hand-in-hand with emotional health, wellness, and healing.<br><br>Q: If Bridge House includes treatment, do residents need to continue therapy or treatment after completing their time at Bridge House? <br>A: The goal of someone’s time at Bridge House lies far beyond simply identifying an accurate diagnosis.  We strive to help our residents truly integrate this new information into their daily life and subsequently improve their level of functioning.  The outcome then allows residents to prepare for the transition to the least restrictive level of care they can manage since there has been an opportunity for forwarding momentum alongside the assessment process.  While we don’t focus on long-term treatment, we have consistently seen that residents’ baselines have improved while they’re with us.  Put, with structured support for healthy sleep hygiene, nutrition, regular exercise, community participation, and the development of self-awareness, people heal.  We also recognize that mental health is a lifelong journey and that our people will likely need support well beyond Bridge House as they step into the next phases of their lives.  Each individual will have unique and specific recommendations drawn up by their treatment team.  No one completes the Bridge House process without extensive communication with next-step providers and support systems before transition.  We must ensure that residents are progressing to the appropriate level of care and bringing with them diagnoses and recommendations that have been accurate and applicable.  This collaboration is essential in ensuring that the clarity provided in one setting is utilized in treatment and life planning in the weeks, months, and years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bridge House is committed to leaving no stone unturned when it comes to assessing our residents’ mental health, and we understand that physical wellbeing is a significant component of mental health.  Our primary focus at Bridge House is to help residents and family members better understand the underlying reasons for issues leading to impairment in day-to-day adaptation and functioning; we seek to understand these issues by applying scientific, social, medical, and observational strategies.  In addition to all of the psychological and observational evaluation that occurs throughout the Bridge House process, our holistic approach to assessment includes a series of medical tests, which we believe are a key part of the puzzle when helping residents who come to us seeking help.  When each resident arrives, we administer genetic testing (if not previously completed), blood work, and toxicology screenings to inform their treatment and assessment.</p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Genetic Testing</strong></h6>



<p>Bridge House offers genetic testing to personalize medicine for each client.  Our clinical team uses the specific information gathered from genetic testing to create a more personalized approach to treatment. Genetic testing allows clinicians to understand if a drug may work for someone before they even try it.</p>



<p>Genomind Professional PGx Express<sup>TM</sup> looks at 24 key genes that are associated with mental health. With this information and a resident’s medical history, our clinicians can make a more informed treatment decision.  Genomind Professional PGx Express supports the genetic profile implications for the treatment of:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>depression</li><li>anxiety</li><li>obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</li><li>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</li><li>bipolar disorder</li><li>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li><li>autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</li><li>schizophrenia</li><li>chronic pain</li></ul>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blood Work</strong></h6>



<p>Bridge House provides in-house blood work which reveals information about a resident’s physical health and gives insight into any physical concerns a resident might be experiencing; the blood work completed will often reveal physical concerns related to many of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>anemia</li><li>thyroid issues/hormone imbalances</li><li>calcium and vitamin D</li><li>B12 and folate&nbsp;</li><li>hemoglobin A1C</li><li>cholesterol levels</li><li>electrolyte imbalances</li><li>liver function</li><li>kidney function</li></ul>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Toxicology Screening</strong></h6>



<p>An initial toxicology screening (drug urinalysis) occurs upon admission and then each week throughout a resident’s stay.  This screening process is essential for assessing a resident who has previously been using drugs. It allows the treatment team to determine when a resident’s body is clear of substances and is closer to a baseline for a more accurate assessment.</p>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Additional Testing: As Indicated</strong></h6>



<p>If our treatment team determines that more information is needed, they will consider additional testing.  Because this testing is administered “as indicated,” there is no definitive list of tests that our clinicians will consider.  The following tests are additional tests we’ve used to understand better specific medical concerns presenting in a resident. Still, a complete list of what can be explored as we engage in an individualized assessment for each person we work with is in no way. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Hormone testing:</strong> If our initial in-house blood work reveals hormone imbalances or other related concerns, our treatment team may determine that further testing is needed.  In this case, we will complete a comprehensive baseline test of hormone production which will help us pinpoint any imbalances and further inform treatment.</li><li><strong>Micronutrient lab test:</strong>  The Bridge House treatment team will consider a micronutrient lab test for residents to gain a better understanding of nutritional deficiencies in order to address any nutritional deficiencies or complications that may be the source of or contributing to any physical or psychological complaints/concerns.  This test measures functional deficiencies at the cellular level and is “an assessment of how well the body utilizes 31 vitamins, minerals, amino/fatty acids, antioxidants, and metabolites, while conveying the body’s need for these micronutrients that enable the body to produce enzymes, hormones, and other substances essential for proper growth, development, and good health.” [Spectracell]</li><li><strong>Food allergy/sensitivity testing:</strong>  If there are concerns that food sensitivities or allergies may be playing a role in a resident’s health, an IgG (immunoglobulin G) test can aid in the structuring of elimination diets that may relieve symptoms of many chronic neurological, gastrointestinal, and movement disorders.</li><li><strong>CT or MRI:</strong>  If the treatment team has concerns about a resident’s neurocognitive function, a CT or MRI of the brain may be indicated to rule out serious illnesses such as brain tumor or possible traumatic brain injury.</li><li><strong>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or Functional Neurocognitive Imaging (fNCI):</strong>  If a resident arrives with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that has not been properly assessed, or if the resident is experiencing continuing issues despite previous TBI treatment, the Bridge House treatment team may determine that further assessment is needed.</li><li><strong>Lyme Disease:</strong> An IGX immunoblot test will be administered if a resident’s history indicates that Lyme Disease may be a concern.</li><li><strong>Sleep study:</strong> Throughout the assessment process it may be determined that a resident should participate in a sleep study in order to diagnose a potential sleep disorder.  By recording brain waves, blood oxygen levels, and other vitals, a sleep study may help pinpoint potential concerns such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea, unexplained chronic insomnia, or other sleep-related disorders.</li></ul>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integrating Medical Testing into Assessment and Treatment</strong></h6>



<p>The results of all of these tests are reviewed and integrated into a resident’s Bridge to Health Report. Recommendations are formulated and discussed with the resident by their treatment team. Our Medical Director, Psychiatrist, Clinical Dietician, and a team of nurses help integrate this information into a care plan that facilitates raising the baseline of physical health for each person receiving support at Bridge House.</p>

<p>As Benjamin Franklin famously said,&nbsp;“Tell me, and I forget, teach me, and I may remember, involve me, and I learn.”  At Bridge House, training and hands-on learning are essential to ensure that staff and the professional team are equipped to support residents in the safest and most supportive ways possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All Bridge House staff receive extensive training upon hire and are subsequently required to attend annual live trainings.  Included are trainings required for compliance for State licensures such as suicide and self-harm prevention, therapeutic de-escalation techniques (AEGIS),&nbsp;Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) training, and CPR certification.  In addition to what is required by the State, Bridge House includes a series of trainings that are specific to our facility and our population.  These trainings include an overview of our philosophy and mission, strategies for milieu management, and basic counseling skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>New direct care staff complete at least 4 days of rigorous supervised hands-on training before working directly with residents.  Our program staff is also taught monthly by Program Director James Healey, who reviews concepts relevant to our residents&#8217; current needs.  Additional training is needed, particularly when we have a resident in need of more specialized care and attention (for example, someone with diabetes, a seizure disorder, cultural considerations such as Kosher diets/religious accommodations, etc.)  Our leadership team is particularly adept at creating specific training to accommodate those needs to ensure that our staff are equipped to support that resident.</p>



<p>These trainings, along with the continual communication with all staff about current milieu needs, keep our residents safe and ensure our staff have the continued education needed to maintain a healthy therapeutic milieu.  In essence, training never stops at Bridge House, and we welcome opportunities to educate our staff regularly.</p>

<p>At Bridge House, we specialize in the assessment of people with highly complex psychiatric and behavioral presentations who have been labeled as treatment-resistant. </p>



<p></p>



<p>In the mental health field, <em>assessment </em>has been conflated with <em>diagnosis</em>, meaning our current approach for determining what an individual is struggling with and what to do about it starts with clearly defining a list of psychiatric diagnoses. This approach is problematic for several reasons:</p>



<p>1. Psychiatric diagnoses are imperfect constructs that are still evolving as our understanding of them deepens. </p>



<p>2. Our current diagnostic system(s) does not account for co-morbidity, which is more common than a collection of otherwise completely isolated conditions.</p>



<p>3. A simple list misses the complex interplay between multiple factors in an individual’s life and does not provide a foundation for understanding the functions of behavior.</p>



<p>Instead of beginning with a list, we begin with a story. We take the time to get to know the person, their experience, and what life has been like for them. A narrative example is the best way to demonstrate how we approach this process. The following is a fictional case that includes many of the elements we often see with our clients and delineates how we approach assessment:</p>



<p>Our imaginary client Barry is a 23-year-old male who was struggling in college and unable to return after a prolonged leave of absence. He has moved back home and feels stuck and trapped. His family is frustrated with his pattern of sleeping in late and avoiding interacting with anyone, and are particularly bothered by his habit of texting them from his bedroom rather than coming downstairs and talking in person. During the pandemic, he had struggled with online classes and felt like he had lost momentum since then. He used to think of himself as a good student and didn’t know what happened or how to get back to his old self. He is experiencing several symptoms of depression: poor concentration, lack of interest, irritability, increased appetite, dysregulated sleep, and, more recently, the development of suicidal thoughts. His biggest complaints currently are feeling like he can’t focus on the most basic things or do anything right, and he feels too exhausted to do any of the things he’d need to do to help himself. He is irritated by the suggestion that he is “just depressed” and is worried something worse is wrong.</p>



<p>Barry is the middle child with an older brother and a younger sister. His early childhood was generally happy but notable for frequent ear infections. In early elementary school, there was concern about inattention and a speech delay, which was later determined to be due to conductive hearing loss. He was treated with bilateral tympanostomy tubes, and his speech improved, but he often still appeared to be disinterested or not paying attention. His father passed away suddenly from brain cancer when he was 11. His mother has a history of depression. Barry&#8217;s older brother began struggling with behavior and left the home to attend boarding school after his father died. Barry first saw a therapist and psychiatrist in 6<sup>th</sup> grade and was tried on several antidepressants but was reluctant to engage. He had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder when he was 12, and more recently, he was diagnosed with adjustment disorder in college. Because of his excessive daytime sleepiness, he had completed a sleep study but was not aware of the results or any recommendations. Barry saw a neurologist for his headaches, who reassured him he did not have a brain tumor like he feared and recommended therapy for stress. Barry tried to attend talk therapy but felt like nothing they talked about “stuck”, and then missed appointments because they were too early in the day, leading to increased frustration from his family members who felt like he wasn’t trying to change his situation and just didn’t seem to care about anything.</p>



<p>After learning about Barry’s story, we begin by writing down all the symptoms reported in a cloud-like formation. We use a wall-sized whiteboard in our weekly treatment team meetings to capture and organize diagnostic information. We are careful to separate out symptoms from behaviors, which we list below.&nbsp; We add to the diagram what we know about the family system and developmental dynamics and assess how these may have influenced the patient’s development, values, and defense patterns. Some symptoms may require additional workup to rule out medical causes. Barry had previously had a sleep study demonstrating mild obstructive sleep apnea. A CPAP machine was obtained for Barry, and he began using it nightly while at Bridge House, and he noticed feeling more alert and less irritable. Barry was also started on an antidepressant in a different category than those he’d tried in the past. When medications and other treatments are indicated, we include them in the diagram and indicate which symptom(s) we are targeting.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Through our informal and formalized measures that we use for assessment, the symptom cloud is divided up, designating discrete symptom complexes (diagnoses) while demonstrating areas of comorbidity. The final diagram resembles a series of overlapping bubbles, with arrows extending outward when describing how these symptoms lead to behaviors and arrows pointing inward, indicating areas of intervention. After completion of the psychological evaluation, which demonstrated relatively lower verbal than non-verbal scores, and processing delay, which was more evident in verbal versus visual tasks, we are able to make more connections between the factors that influenced the presentation of the client’s symptoms, behaviors, and most importantly to determine the function of those behaviors so that effective interventions can be crafted.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Using the diagnostic diagram as a reference tool, we generate a diagnostic formulation that answers these questions:</p>



<p></p>



<p>1. What is occurring?</p>



<p>Barry has major depressive disorder, a previously untreated sleep disorder, and an auditory processing disorder. Yet, the combination of all of these conditions layered on top of his personal history, viewed through the lens of his unique cognitive profile, has created his current presentation. This constellation of symptoms specifically amplified his physical symptoms of constant exhaustion and frequent headaches leading him to worry more about a medical problem rather than a psychiatric one. His beliefs about the utility of therapy were colored by his prior experiences with treatment after the loss of his father because, at the time, his symptoms were more consistent with grief than depression.</p>



<p></p>



<p>2. Why is it occurring?</p>



<p>Barry’s depression arose from his genetic predisposition and due to life events. Barry has always had chronic congestion and gained weight during his depressive episode, leading to him developing obstructive sleep apnea, which quickly becomes a feedback loop that generates increased weight gain and worsening symptom severity. This prevents him from getting restful sleep and contributes to difficulties concentrating, remembering important things, and maintaining consistent energy. Barry also has auditory processing disorder, a condition where a person can hear, but their brain doesn’t know what to do with the information. This may have occurred because he had conductive hearing loss as a child during periods important for language acquisition. As a result, he struggles to pay attention to auditory input in certain settings, like when too many people are talking at once or he cannot see the person who is talking. This made college extra challenging, both in large classes and when lectures were online. He used to be able to compensate for some of these challenges, but his fatigue and increased difficulty concentrating due to untreated sleep apnea and evolving depression made it impossible. When he’s overwhelmed, he appears disinterested or like he is not listening, damaging relationships. He has learned to retreat and withdraw rather than risk negative feedback. He focuses more on physical complaints because they are easier to describe than more complex emotions, and he has learned that keeping his emotions to himself is safer.  Lastly, he appears to be &#8220;help rejecting&#8221; because his early experiences with treatment were invalidating, and his more recent experiences occurred in a format that was hard for his brain to process. Hence, he developed the belief that treatment doesn’t work for him.</p>



<p>3. What is the least restrictive level of care that can meet Barry’s needs?</p>



<p>For Barry, living at home makes him feel acutely aware of his lack of progression in life and sets him up to compare himself unfavorably to his siblings &#8211; the environment is not conducive to avoiding unhelpful thought patterns that keep him stuck; however, he still needs support. Barry would benefit from a transitional living level of care – a model of treatment that begins in a more supported environment, facilitating skill-building and progressing toward greater independence through meeting small goals. The ideal program for Barry’s next steps would include a period of living in a small group of similar peers, participating in therapy using other methods besides talking which can be hard for him to process, meeting regularly with a psychiatrist to manage his medications, seeing a sleep specialist to maintain and optimize his CPAP use, and then transitioning to living independently with those same wraparound supports. Since Barry has consistently expressed wanting to return to college, it would be recommended that he start by taking one class while in transitional care. He will most likely be successful if he uses this opportunity to request accommodations for auditory processing disorder and then practices multiple strategies to determine what works best for him in a college setting.</p>



<p></p>



<p>After transitional care that has been informed by an in-depth and accurate assessment, Barry will have his medical and psychiatric conditions managed and will feel more energetic, engaged, and open to positive experiences. He will have gained a greater understanding that not all bad feelings are bad: grief and sadness are normal responses to bad situations, AND when they are prolonged and interfere with the ability to live a normal life, it is possible and necessary to treat them. He will have learned that there is a reason for his difficulty understanding things in some settings but not others. He will have stopped being frustrated with himself because he has tools to navigate perceiving sounds differently – he knows that online zoom presentations with a narrating voice but no visual of a person talking do not work well for him, so he seeks out other formats for school and work, and asks for accommodations when necessary without embarrassment.</p>



<p></p>



<p>By beginning with the client’s story and lived history and utilizing a visual aid for our understanding of complex interactions between genetics, emotions, behavior patterns, beliefs, and environment, we can establish a comprehensive view of a client’s challenges. Our assessment does eventually include a list of diagnoses. Still, the path we take to arrive at those conclusions involves a more nuanced understanding, resulting in more accurate recommendations for the right support for our clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Being transgender is often trauma in itself.  We like to have great empathy for individuals who are trans when welcoming them to Bridge House. It is important to fully understand what it means to be transgender before treating or supporting a person who identifies.  To be transgender means that a person identifies as a different gender than their biological birth gender.  Research has shown that people who identify as transgender often possess the brain of the gender they identify and not their biological gender assigned at birth (Cleveland Clinic, 2019).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trans people are often victims of violence and discrimination.  An open transgender status frequently finds individuals forced into unemployment, poverty, homelessness, and/or survival sex work.  In 2019, at least 22 transgender and non-conforming individuals were victims of fatal violence.  This number also does not accurately depict the number of deaths because many police reports have misgendered these victims (Human Rights Campaign, 2019).  Trans women of color face some of the highest levels of discrimination in any population nationwide (National LGTBQ Taskforce, 2019).  Access to healthcare is minimal, as they are frequently turned away by doctors, therapists, and medical professionals due to personal beliefs, fear, or not specializing in transgender care.  They also face daily persecution due to others not using their preferred pronouns, which results in the daily revisiting of trauma and magnifying what the individual sees as “wrong” with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most people who are transgender learn from an early age to feel uncomfortable in their own bodies—they look in the mirror and see the parts that aren’t supposed to be theirs. They look at what’s wrong with them.  An Instagram post by @TBESTIG circulated social media recently about what it was like to be trans. It shared about how people who don’t fully understand often say, “I identified as a dinosaur when I was six, kids that age are too young to know they’re trans.”  The post then continues, “Nah, mate.  You didn’t identify as a dinosaur. You didn’t cry yourself to sleep because you couldn’t figure out why you had no tail.  You didn’t feel an inexplicable sense of shame at your lack of claws.  When you saw yourself in a mirror in a dinosaur costume, you weren’t upset about all the non-dinosaur bits you could still see.  When others saw the costume, you weren’t brought to tears by them treating you like a child-wearing-a-costume instead of a real dinosaur” (@TBESTIG, 2019).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being transgender creates an identity crisis from an early age because your body—something that you should rely on and trust—is telling you that you are not allowed to be yourself.  This results in struggles with self-confidence, self-esteem, and difficulty finding a place in society because transgender individuals often feel like they don’t belong in social settings due to their foundational feeling of not belonging in their own bodies.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>When we approach treating people who identify as transgender, the most important thing we remember is: if someone says they are trans, we believe them.  When this person shares their preferred pronouns and names, we use them.  Not only does this validate who they identify as, but it validates them as a human in a world that often treats them less-than.  A person who is trans has already decided their gender and their place. It is not anyone else’s place to decide that for them.  We are not here to change their identity, but we are here to support them through the process of reinforcing who they are and who they want to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People who identify as transgender are not seeking attention and are not “going through a phase.”  Being transgender is a risk in today’s society—it is unsafe, it is a target for discrimination and violence.  It is imperative to consider how important it is for someone to transition if they are willing to face the risks of transitioning (violence, discrimination, loss of relationships, loss of family, homelessness, poverty, etc.) versus living as the wrong gender.  This isn’t a choice, but the individual’s biological makeup, as shown in the Cleveland Clinic research (link below).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In understanding a person’s experience in being transgender, therapy can often lead to exploring the person’s relationship with gender throughout their life.  Being trans inherently brings trauma, and it is important to explore this in therapy in a non-threatening approach that builds from a non-judgmental foundation of safety in the therapeutic relationship.  People who have experienced trauma often will resort to behaviors of survival.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being trans isn’t bad, and it isn’t something to change.  And when we step out of the individual’s way and don’t try and change who they identify themselves to be, we empower them to take control of the life they want and deserve.&nbsp;</p>
