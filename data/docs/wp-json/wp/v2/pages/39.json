Integrating group therapy, individual therapy, family therapy, recreational activities, community outings, and a thorough battery of diagnostic evaluations, assessment is taken far beyond the boundaries of what can be achieved in a hospital ward or doctor\u2019s office.  Bridge House\u2019s comprehensive assessment and Bridge to Health Report bring clarity to patterns and cycles of maladaptive behaviors to chart a course for effective treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long and short-term goals are clearly established with each Bridge House resident as a personalized treatment plan is developed.  Long-term goals are aimed at returning residents to full and constructive participation in society.  Short-term goals are designed to help residents understand their particular set of difficulties, increase trust in themselves and others, learn the social skills necessary to develop healthy relationships, regulate emotions adequately to participate in daily life activities, learn independent life skills, understand diagnoses, and increase executive functioning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biopsychosocial Assessment<\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-medium\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"286\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/4hfpfuyb14k-e1621454600236-286x300.jpg\" alt=\"woman in brown jacket walking on pathway between trees during daytime\" class=\"wp-image-853\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/4hfpfuyb14k-e1621454600236-286x300.jpg 286w, https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/4hfpfuyb14k-e1621454600236-768x806.jpg 768w, https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/4hfpfuyb14k-e1621454600236.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Bridge House offers the most sophisticated, holistic approach to assessment available today.&nbsp; Dr. Chris McRoberts, Director of Diagnostic Services, approaches assessment from a biopsychosocial model, which sees human beings as people with problems in medical, psychological, and social realms rather than as broken objects to be fixed.  This model requires the Bridge House team to evaluate and understand each resident\u2019s physical, cognitive, emotional, and social status with an understanding that this status is ever-changing.  Using the real-world environment to drive assessment, residents are evaluated over the course of weeks rather than hours and in a setting with activities that mirror \u201cnormal\u201d life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most current medical and biological tests are utilized to investigate how physical health impacts the mental health of residents. Tried and true psychological measures, including personality tests, projective tests, and a wide variety of cognitive tests, are used to assess driving factors contributing to a person\u2019s psychological makeup.  This is all accomplished while the resident is safe, comfortable, motivated for change, eating a healthy diet, and getting adequate rest.  Dietetics, occupational therapy, and psychiatric assessments round out the comprehensive evaluation with each client.  And, leaving no stone unturned, unmatched social and behavioral assessment occurs over several months when skilled clinicians observe residents as they gradually resume activities of daily living both on and off the Bridge House campus.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/feeling-down-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-77\" style=\"width:550px;height:367px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/feeling-down-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/feeling-down-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/feeling-down-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/feeling-down-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/feeling-down.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bridge House Resident Profile<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bridge House residents struggle with mental illnesses of many types, neurocognitive disorders, learning disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and substance use and abuse.  They are commonly dealing with issues related to depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.  Often trauma has played a significant role in their lives. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their problems may have been developing over many years or may have arisen recently.  They may have experienced years of chronic sadness, social alienation, suicidality, or recently emerging symptoms of bipolar disorder, depression, or psychosis that may have caused a rapid deterioration in their day-to-day functioning.  Bridge House residents and their loved ones are looking to understand better the challenges they have faced in their lives. &nbsp;They have commonly tried various treatment modalities in the past and have been left without feelings of success.  They have gone after &#8220;treating&#8221; or &#8220;fixing&#8221; rather than truly understanding and have been left feeling like &#8220;the other&#8221; and without direction.  They join us to&nbsp;create a road map to move forward with clarity, hope, and purpose. &nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Bridge House is the premier diagnostic and assessment-oriented residential treatment center for adults.
