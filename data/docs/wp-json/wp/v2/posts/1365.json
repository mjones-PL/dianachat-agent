Yoga and massage complement each other and achieve maximum benefit with collaborative practice. I assist residents by strengthening their core and improving sore or weak muscle groups through poses, stretching, and massage. I also introduce a meditative element to sessions. Consistency is key to any healing process. We achieve a peaceful state of mind, a happy outlook, and a strong body through consistent practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><strong>Massage can release energy from your body that you don&#8217;t realize you are holding.<\/strong>&nbsp; Our residents are encouraged to learn about the connection between their brain and their body.&nbsp; \u201cWhere am I holding something?&nbsp; How do I let it go?\u201d&nbsp; Reminding them to breathe during a massage and encouraging them to slow their breathing is part of the meditative experience.&nbsp; We need human and physical touch in our lives. Avoiding touch and movement is a common defense mechanism for people.&nbsp; Understanding this is the first step to breaking down these barriers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\">At Bridge House, it is common to see residents who are quite resistant and fearful of touch in some cases.&nbsp; When working with these individuals, I have to realize that every person who comes through our door seeks a safe space. I must develop a relationship first to provide that safe space. I do an initial assessment with each resident called the Mind, Body Spirit assessment.&nbsp; I am seeking to understand each individual\u2019s relationship with their own body and with their mind. It is common in these assessments that I am told, \u201cI don&#8217;t like yoga,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t relax during the massage,\u201d \u201cMeditation is frightening for me.\u201d In an effort to create a safe space for them, I do what I can to be a part of their lives while they are at Bridge House. I will continue to express my genuine interest in them, get to know them, and build a relationship that way. This builds trust, and relationship, the premise upon which everything is based at Bridge House.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\">I teach an experiential group on Saturdays. In this group, we cook, garden, and learn new things together. I can connect with individuals in these different settings.&nbsp; I can create trust with those who may not be otherwise receptive to the yoga and massage offerings. <strong>In the gardening group, we can see the beauty and growth of putting a seed in the ground and taking care of it.&nbsp; This can draw many parallels to the Bridge House process and health and healing. If you put time, work, and focused energy into doing, you will see those same results.<\/strong> It&#8217;s rewarding to work with people who may be going through some of the most challenging times of their lives and be able to bring them some element of peace and calm.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bridge House offers me a unique opportunity to support others in their healing journey; through yoga and massage.
