All are given an opportunity to explain what they painted on the rock and share any specific well-wishes for the resident. After everyone has had a chance to speak, the group will move out to the courtyard.&nbsp; The departing resident will stand on the bridge with their rock. They will be encouraged to share about their time at Bridge House and will often express gratitude to those who have helped and supported them during this journey. They then place their rock in the creek bed or the courtyard, creating a lasting legacy of their time with us, and signifying their accomplishments.&nbsp; These rocks serve as a reminder to other residents of all who have walked across this bridge before them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For many of our residents, completing the Bridge House process is the first thing they have successfully completed in a very long time.&nbsp; We recognize this, and we celebrate this accomplishment.&nbsp; The Bridge Ceremony has been a tradition for our residents since we opened our doors in 2017.
