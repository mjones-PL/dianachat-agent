Often residents are involved in hands-on activities with Brooke to help them learn new cooking techniques, recipes, and menu\/meal planning&nbsp; Her goal is to help residents expand their tastebuds and interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Brooke teaches residents about snack foods from the grocery store \u201cthat won\u2019t kill you\u201d in her words.&nbsp; It\u2019s a challenge for all of us to walk into a store and avoid foods that are bad for us because the labels are designed to draw us in.&nbsp; The snack food industry is a billion-dollar industry, making it really hard to compete against.&nbsp; We strive to help our residents understand healthier snack substitutes so they are able to make educated decisions while grocery shopping. Some residents may lack the skills and knowledge to prepare meals and make healthy choices.&nbsp; Others have come to us from places where they had little to no control over what they could eat.&nbsp; We aim to build on their skill-set and plant seeds of knowledge while shifting their whole mindset to <strong>\u201cHow do I improve my whole-body health?\u201d<\/strong>&nbsp; Food is just one of the cogs on the wheel of healthy life.&nbsp; Every bite we take influences what happens in our gut, and subsequently, what happens in our mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/FullSizeRender-8-2-1024x861.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1535\" width=\"373\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/FullSizeRender-8-2-1024x861.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/FullSizeRender-8-2-300x252.jpg 300w, https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/FullSizeRender-8-2-768x646.jpg 768w, https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/FullSizeRender-8-2-1536x1292.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/FullSizeRender-8-2-70x60.jpg 70w, https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/FullSizeRender-8-2.jpg 2013w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Brooke collaborates with our two full-time Chefs in meal planning and supporting individualized dietary plans based on a whole-foods approach.&nbsp; Our meals are prepared fresh, onsite, and from scratch three meals a day.&nbsp; The culinary team runs two 6-week seasonal menus for fall\/winter, and spring\/summer.&nbsp; The meals are designed to easily accommodate gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, vegetarian, or kosher needs as well as other allergies or intolerances.&nbsp; They are given foods that are steamed, roasted, grilled, baked, and raw, to expose them to all types of preparations.&nbsp; We strive to fill their plates with as many different colored foods that are fresh, delicious, nutritious, and healing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cWhen you fuel your body properly, you heal your body.
