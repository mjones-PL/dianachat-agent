Included are trainings required for compliance for State licensures such as suicide and self-harm prevention, therapeutic de-escalation techniques (AEGIS),&nbsp;Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) training, and CPR certification.  In addition to what is required by the State, Bridge House includes a series of trainings that are specific to our facility and our population.  These trainings include an overview of our philosophy and mission, strategies for milieu management, and basic counseling skills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New direct care staff complete at least 4 days of rigorous supervised hands-on training before working directly with residents.  Our program staff is also taught monthly by Program Director James Healey, who reviews concepts relevant to our residents&#8217; current needs.  Additional training is needed, particularly when we have a resident in need of more specialized care and attention (for example, someone with diabetes, a seizure disorder, cultural considerations such as Kosher diets\/religious accommodations, etc.)  Our leadership team is particularly adept at creating specific training to accommodate those needs to ensure that our staff are equipped to support that resident.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These trainings, along with the continual communication with all staff about current milieu needs, keep our residents safe and ensure our staff have the continued education needed to maintain a healthy therapeutic milieu.  In essence, training never stops at Bridge House, and we welcome opportunities to educate our staff regularly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Philosophy and Statement:<\/strong>\u00a0Description and orientation of the genesis of Bridge house.
