A thoughtful and dynamic leader, he has previously served as Executive Director, Clinical Director, Program Director, and Primary Therapist at some of the most highly regarded treatment programs in the country.  Rod brings to Bridge House not only his clinical verve but also a unique, sophisticated approach to program oversight and management. He is passionate about delivering innovative and ethical mental health treatment in a nurturing and normative setting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rod received his graduate degree from the University of Denver.  He is a licensed clinical social worker and certified trauma therapist with more than twenty years of experience in mental health, addiction treatment, and program management.  Since entering the field in 1992, he has delivered treatment to thousands of clients and their families, supervised hundreds of mental health professionals, led three successful organizations, and developed cutting-edge programming now implemented in various treatment settings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PERSONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>A recreation and outdoor enthusiast, Rod can be found riding the half-pipe on his snowboard, camping, and fly-fishing in the mountains, or dropping into bowls on his skateboard.  He also&nbsp;enjoys the ongoing adventure of raising two high-spirited children.  In addition to spending time with his&nbsp;children and in the outdoors, Rod loves restoring vintage German cars.  He worked as a chef to put himself through college and uses his culinary talents to the occasional delight of family and friends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Rod believes that humans are at their best when their emotional, social, spiritual, physical, and intellectual needs are met.  He refers to this concept as the Spheres Of Healthy Living.&nbsp; All too often, people struggling with mental illness, neuro-cognitive disorders, or addiction have never acquired the knowledge and skill to engage in these spheres effectively or have lost a sense of balance in these spheres of healthy living.&nbsp; Every person\u2019s experience is unique in terms of what they experience regarding hope, health, and healing.&nbsp; For some, an experience of hope motivates them to learn what is required to heal and experience health.&nbsp; For others, they may experience a sense of health and healing, which leads them to believe that they are worthy and capable of living a life of purpose and joy.  Hope, healing, and health are interdependent and can be considered by-products of one another.&nbsp; It is nearly impossible to experience one without the other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Working in mental health since 1992<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Working at Bridge House since 2017<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR \/ FOUNDER<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":184,"template":"","department":[8,7],"class_list":{"0":"post-139","1":"team","2":"type-team","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"department-clinical","7":"department-leadership","8":"entry"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team\/139","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/184"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=139"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"department","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/department?post=139"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
