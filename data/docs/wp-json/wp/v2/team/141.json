She pursued adult psychiatric training at Vanderbilt University and completed a two-year child &amp; adolescent sub-specialty fellowship.  Psychiatric training at Vanderbilt offered Dr. Schlansky a wealth of opportunities to work with leaders in the field in treating first-break psychosis and mood disorders, substance use disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders with equal focus on psychopharmacology and psychotherapy.  Dr. Schlansky\u2019s interest in both the interpersonal and biological sequelae of attachment during early life leads to her interest in treating children, adolescents, and transitional age youth and the entire family system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Schlansky is passionate about delivering the best evidence-based psychiatric treatment within a collaborative model with the identified patient and their family.  She believes psychiatric diagnosis should be a collaborative process during which both the physician and the patient develop an understanding of current symptomatology and arrive together at a treatment plan in accordance with the patient\u2019s goals and values. Dr. Schlansky is particularly skilled in treating patients with complex presentations that have previously eluded accurate understanding or effective treatment.  Her extensive focus on family therapy during training allows for a deep understanding of the dynamic and genetic factors that may have contributed to a patient\u2019s current presentation.  Her warm, compassionate, and friendly communication style allows for patients and families to feel heard and supported throughout the treatment process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PERSONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Schlansky lives on a small hobby farm in Utah which she shares with her husband, six goats, a flock of chickens, two pigs, two rabbits, and one very spoiled chihuahua.  When she\u2019s not working on the farm, she enjoys practicing yoga (sometimes with goats), climbing, stand-up paddleboarding, and painting in her home studio.  Her interest in art has expanded into her psychiatric practice in recent years, developing therapeutic art practices for patients to cultivate their creativity and experience the freedom of personal expression.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Both conceptually and scientifically, mental health treatment has changed considerably in the recent past, and Dr. Schlansky believes that Bridge House\u2019s treatment philosophy represents the next phase in this evolution.  Bridge House offers mental health care in a manner and environment that encourages patients to take their first steps in their personal healing journey and inspires hope for a future on the other side of treatment. We believe that aligning with our patients in this process facilitates movement toward our shared goal of long-lasting health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working in Mental Health since&nbsp;2013<br><br>Working at Bridge House since&nbsp;2020<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MEDICAL DIRECTOR \/ PSYCHIATRIST<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":182,"template":"","department":[8,7,10],"class_list":{"0":"post-141","1":"team","2":"type-team","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"department-clinical","7":"department-leadership","8":"department-medical-specialists","9":"entry"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team\/141","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/182"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=141"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"department","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/department?post=141"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
