She began working in mental health in 1986 as a direct care staff, program manager, and program administrator for a residential therapeutic program.  While living in Colorado, Julie also spent a few years as a case manager for the Colorado AIDS Project.  In 2008, Julie began her work as a physician assistant in family practice, addressing clients along a full spectrum of care, from birth to geriatric populations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a health care provider, Julie&#8217;s goal is to work as a team member alongside her patients and others involved and impacted to develop the most holistic approach and best medication plan.  To do this, she believes that it is crucial to look at all aspects of a person&#8217;s life that impact overall health, such as nutrition, exercise, sleep, and interpersonal relationships.  Julie\u2019s work as a physician assistant has always involved evidence-based medicine, and she is committed to lifelong learning to enhance her knowledge and skills continually.

At home, Julie spends quality time with her two daughters and son-in-law, watching grandchildren grow. Before moving to Utah, Julie enjoyed living in the mountains of Colorado for 25 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Julie believes that the struggling human spirit is resilient when nurtured, supported, educated, and allowed to grow and evolve.  She believes that when there is resilience and hope, healing and health will follow.  In her diverse personal and professional experiences, she has found herself drawn to circumstances in which people thrive when supported by compassion and collaboration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working in healthcare since&nbsp;1986<br>Working at Bridge House since 2020<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PSYCHIATRIC PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":181,"template":"","department":[8,10],"class_list":{"0":"post-142","1":"team","2":"type-team","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"department-clinical","7":"department-medical-specialists","8":"entry"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team\/142","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/181"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=142"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"department","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/department?post=142"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
