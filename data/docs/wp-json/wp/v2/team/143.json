JEREMY A. CHILES<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ASSESSMENT PSYCHOLOGIST<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CREDENTIALS<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ph.D. Clinical Psychology, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bachelor of Psychology, Minor in History, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Licensed Clinical Psychologist&nbsp;since 1999<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PROFESSIONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up the son of a clinical psychologist, Dr. Chiles observed a tireless effort on the part of his father to help and support individuals and families faced with a range of difficulties.  This instilled in him a deep interest in other people and a desire to help them find peace and harmony in their lives.  Even as a teenager, Dr. Chiles believed he would one day be involved in helping others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A foundation in research and evidence-based practices as part of his education at Brigham Young University and his training in the years since has provided the basis for Dr. Chiles\u2019 work with children, adolescents, and adults.  Dr. Chiles was involved in research during his years in graduate school and continues to see the value of staying current in his knowledge of mental health study and its utility in approach to assessment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his time in graduate school, Dr. Chiles took part in internships and practicums that exposed him to various profiles and clients with emotional and intellectual challenges.  His doctoral program focused on assessing and treating mental disorders and cognitive differences in both children and adults.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Chiles spent time training and working at the Utah State Hospital, Utah State Prison, private practice clinics, a rural community mental health center, and a large community mental health center leading up to his licensure as a clinical psychologist in 1999.  Dr. Chiles worked for Psychological Testing Services with Bridge House\u2019s founder Dr. McRoberts for several years.  Subsequently, Dr. Chiles founded his own practice, Psychological Evaluation, and Assessment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Jeremy Chiles has been working with children, adolescents, adults, and their families since 1995.  Since 2003, his focus has been on providing evaluation and assessment to help individuals better understand intellectual, achievement, personality, emotional, social, and relationship patterns and challenges that impact their ability to grow and experience success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PERSONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Utah Native, Dr. Chiles enjoys the mountains, rivers, deserts, and other scenery that the State offers.  His focus outside of work is on being a father and supporting his three children as they pursue their goals, hopes, and dreams.  Dr. Chiles\u2019 dog, Willow, is often by his side on his different adventures camping, fly fishing, hiking, and skiing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Chiles believes that finding balance across all aspects of life is of core importance to health and healing.  People experience a wide range of psychological issues, physical illness, social or interpersonal difficulties, cognitive deficits, and\/or learning challenges.  Despite these various challenges, each person has the potential to find balance and, in turn, health.  In working towards this ongoing balance goal, Dr. Chiles sees the value in diagnosing and treating a range of mental health challenges.  Dr. Chiles believes that understanding the role of family, friends, work, school, exercise, and other activities\/responsibilities, is also critical in this ongoing process.  Finding peace and contentment regularly necessitates a style of navigating obstacles that places value on openness, acceptance, and purposeful intervention.  Dr. Chiles focuses on taking a compassionate and realistic approach to work with individuals that gives meaning to and validates their history, current challenges, and hopes and goals.<br><br>Working in mental health since 1995<br><br>Working at Bridge House since 2017<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ASSESSMENT PSYCHOLOGIST<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":180,"template":"","department":[8],"class_list":{"0":"post-143","1":"team","2":"type-team","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"department-clinical","7":"entry"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team\/143","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/180"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=143"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"department","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/department?post=143"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
