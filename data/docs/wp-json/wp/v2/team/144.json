Sue spends a lot of time cooking in the kitchen and is always looking for new dishes to share with her family and friends.  She loves to travel and explore the amazing history that is unique to each geographical area.  Sue is an avid Utah Utes football fan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Sue believes in the power of relationships. &nbsp;Without relationships, all humans struggle with hope, health, and healing.  It is the quest of creating, building, and maintaining relationships that feed our existence.  She believes that all interactions have an impact on us every day.  In all interactions, we should capitalize on how we are saying it, why we are saying it, and our intent.  This idea creates awareness for Sue in her approach in therapy each day.  Every interaction, big or small, creates an awareness in her relationships to foster hope, health, and healing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working in Mental Health since 1997<br><br>Working at Bridge House since 2018<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PRIMARY THERAPIST<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":179,"template":"","department":[8],"class_list":{"0":"post-144","1":"team","2":"type-team","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"department-clinical","7":"entry"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team\/144","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/179"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=144"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"department","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/department?post=144"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
