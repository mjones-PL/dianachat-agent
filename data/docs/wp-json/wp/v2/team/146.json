After several years of fieldwork as a caseworker and a direct-care staff in residential treatment, Rachael received her master\u2019s degree in social work from the University of Utah in 2008 and has worked as a clinician since 2010. During that time, not only has Rachael worked in a variety of clinical settings, she has also worked in a community setting for the Ute Indian Tribe\u2019s Victims of Crime department, working with all ages in crisis. Before joining the Bridge House team, Rachael was the director and primary therapist of a young adult transition program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PERSONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachael is a lifelong Utah resident and proud of her Native American heritage, which is a large part of her identity. She is an enrolled member of the Ute Indian Tribe and is also from the Hopi tribe of Arizona. During her free time, Rachael prioritizes her community, spending time with her family and friends. She also loves sports (especially basketball) and is a die-hard Utah Jazz and University of Utah fan who attends as many live sporting events as she can. Rachael also enjoys live music and road trips and has wandered through most states west of the Mississippi River by car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachael sees health, hope, and healing as inextricably linked: when one begins to spark, the others naturally follow. She believes that the healing process usually begins with hope, as people develop trust and connections with those around them. She believes that healthy, genuine, and compassionate relationships are the foundation to feeling hope and moving forward in the healing process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working in mental health since 2002<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working at Bridge House since 2020<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CLINICAL DIRECTOR<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":169,"template":"","department":[8,7],"class_list":{"0":"post-146","1":"team","2":"type-team","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"department-clinical","7":"department-leadership","8":"entry"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team\/146","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/169"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=146"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"department","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/department?post=146"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
