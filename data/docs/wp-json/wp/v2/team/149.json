She enjoys working in the mental health field, and it is that field that Sindi has chosen to devote her career to. Sindi received her Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Nursing and is currently pursuing a Nurse Practitioner Degree to further her education and understanding of the field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to joining the Bridge House team, Sindi worked in the ER at Heritage Park from 2012-2014. From there she moved on to Elevations RTC and Viewpoint Center where she worked from 2014-2021. She was hired as a nurse and was soon promoted to the Director of Nursing, a position that she held from 2015-2021. Before beginning her journey in healthcare, Sindi owned and operated her own printing business from 2000-2010. This gave her an in-depth understanding of what it means to run a business and how to be a good boss and manager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PERSONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Sindi was raised in Eastern Montana on a cattle ranch surrounded for miles by the great outdoors. Her childhood was filled with farm life: growing crops, breaking horses, riding motorcycles, and keeping the ranch running. It wasn\u2019t until she was almost 20 years old that she finally bought meat and eggs from the store. She rode the school bus 12 miles every day on a bus filled with students from Kindergarten to 12<sup>th<\/sup> grade which made for an entertaining 12-mile ride.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1984 she moved to Utah with her eldest daughter. It was here in Utah that she had her second and third daughters, raised the three of them, and took it upon herself to be actively involved in their lives. Sindi found herself wearing many hats during this time. From parent to soccer coach to Girl Scout leader. Sindi was involved in it all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Sindi loves spending time with her husband, daughters, and grandchildren. She still rides motorcycles to this day, fuels her avid love of the outdoors through hiking, camping, and biking, and finds time for herself through crafting and connects with her loved ones through cooking. Chicken piccata is currently her favorite dish to make, and one of the more recent recipes she taught herself. Her home is made that much cozier by the presence of her two Cornish Rex cats, Cam and Kickstand who provide unconditional love and entertainment. Her dream is to one-day own property big enough where she could own horses again, grow a garden big enough to handle more than just tomatoes and squash, and have the whole family over for the holidays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>To Sindi, Hope, Health and Healing mean more than can be put into words. It means personal growth and confidence. If you have those three things, Sindi believes you can achieve a sense of wholeness. They work together to create a fully realized human being. This can look like independence, self-esteem, and autonomy. Sindi actively incorporates this into her life by keeping an open mind, continuing to educate herself, and maintaining a positive attitude. Hope, Health, and Healing has had a resounding impact on Sindi\u2019s life because she has lived it herself. Being the parent, friend, and sibling to those who have struggled with their mental health has given her a deeper understanding of what it\u2019s like to be on the other side of the table and take that understanding with her as she navigates helping others from the clinical side. Sindi\u2019s goal is to provide more support and understanding for residents and their families because it is her belief that we can have a healthier society through a better support system for mental health. Sindi wants to be a part of that support network to ensure people have resources to help themselves when they are ready.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working in Mental Health since 2014<br><br>Working at Bridge House since 2021<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>DIRECTOR OF NURSING<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":1418,"template":"","department":[8,7,10],"class_list":{"0":"post-149","1":"team","2":"type-team","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"department-clinical","7":"department-leadership","8":"department-medical-specialists","9":"entry"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team\/149","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1418"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=149"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"department","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/department?post=149"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
