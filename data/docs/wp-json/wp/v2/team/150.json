She discovered her passion for admissions in 2012 when she began working in the admissions office at a therapeutic boarding school. Since that time, Susanna has held admissions leadership roles in highly regarded residential, outdoor therapy, and specialty\/clinical coaching settings. Informed by her background in education, Susanna approaches admissions with a recognition of each person\u2019s unique needs. She compassionately guides families through what can be an emotional and challenging process, and her work with others is founded on authenticity, integrity, and connection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PERSONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Susanna grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, but decided to venture west for college and has not looked back since! She resides in Bozeman, Montana, with her husband and two children. In her free time, she enjoys golfing, camping, river floats, and cheering on the Montana State Bobcats, her adopted hometown team. She also proudly serves as a board member for SLAM, a non-profit organization supporting Montana&#8217;s local artists and musicians.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Susanna believes everyone has a path toward hope, health, and healing, even if it is sometimes circuitous or rocky. When we can take the time to slow down, pay attention, and lean into our journey, we unlock so much potential to understand and appreciate our individual human experiences. In that vein, Susanna appreciates Bridge House\u2019s holistic approach to seeking understanding and then using that information to empower our residents to make decisions aligned with their hope, health, and healing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Working in mental health since 2012<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working at Bridge House since 2024<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ADMISSIONS ASSOCIATE<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":1880,"template":"","department":[9],"class_list":{"0":"post-150","1":"team","2":"type-team","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"department-admissions-outreach","7":"entry"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team\/150","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1880"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=150"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"department","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/department?post=150"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
