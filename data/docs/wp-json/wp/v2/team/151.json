MARASCO, LCSW<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PRIMARY THERAPIST<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CREDENTIALS<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Masters of Social Work, University of Utah<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bachelors of Science in Parks, Recreation, and Tourism with emphasis in Experiential Education, University of Utah<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trained in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Therapy<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trained in Dialectic Behavioral Therapy (DBT)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trained in Mind Body Bridging (MBB)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trained in Motivational Interviewing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trained in Equine Assisted Psychotherapy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PROFESSIONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Anna has been in the mental health and substance use disorder fields for over a decade.  Her professional career has taken her across the nation to programs in Florida, New Mexico, and Utah.  She has held roles as clinical and program director across these three states in mental health, addiction, and dual diagnosis treatment.  Anna\u2019s extensive training in trauma-informed therapy allows her to explore deeper issues that are often overlooked.  Anna\u2019s specialty areas include trauma, personality disorders, grief and loss, depression, anxiety, gender identity, transgender issues, cognitive disabilities, and addiction.<br>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PERSONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Anna loves learning and education and is presently working on a Master of Fine Arts in creative writing.  She spends a lot of her free time writing and has published several poems and short stories, and is publishing a novel.  Anna incorporates her mental health knowledge and experience in her writing, with hopes of normalizing conversations on mental illness and reducing stigmas.  When not writing, Anna is often found hiking in the mountains or enjoying time with the love of her life: her horse, Henry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Anna believes that every client is trying their best and deserves to be met with unconditional positive regard at all times.  She also believes that hope is present even in the most difficult of circumstances.  Thich Nhat Hanh once said, \u201cbecause you are alive, anything is possible.\u201d  Anna fully believes in this statement.  Every second of every day is a new opportunity and, because of this, we don\u2019t have to define ourselves based on past experiences.  Anna believes that everyone possesses inherent core worth, no matter obstacles faced in the past, present, or future. Every day we get to rewrite our story.<br>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working in Mental Health since 2008<br><br>Working at Bridge House since 2018<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PRIMARY THERAPIST<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":172,"template":"","department":[8],"class_list":{"0":"post-151","1":"team","2":"type-team","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"department-clinical","7":"entry"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team\/151","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/172"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=151"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"department","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/department?post=151"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
