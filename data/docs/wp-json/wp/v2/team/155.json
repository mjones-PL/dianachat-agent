He focuses heavily on the therapeutic alliance. His therapeutic expertise and versatility extend beyond the traditional office setting. He is excellent at helping clients assess and understand obstacles hindering forward progression. Jeff has extensive experience providing parent coaching and family therapy to help guide clients and families during difficult times. He is well-versed in a multitude of clinical issues, including substance abuse, thought disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, self-esteem issues, trauma and abuse, personality disorders, family discord, grief, processing deficits, and identity issues. Jeff\u2019s uncanny ability to establish rapport allows him to connect with many clients who have cycled through many other programs and therapists before working with him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PERSONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff enjoys spending time with his wife, three daughters, two stepdaughters, and three rambunctious doodles. He is a native of Utah and is proud that his daughters attend the same schools he did as a child. Jeff enjoys running, basketball, snowboarding, and most things active. He has an affinity for all non-fiction topics and is often engrossed in a documentary, podcast, or book. Jeff is a self-described \u201chandyman\u201d who often works on some type of home improvement project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff believes that finding hope, health, and healing is not linear and generic but unique to each person\u2019s mental health journey.&nbsp; He ascribes to the notion that the difficult times we face as humans are just as valuable as the good times, granting us hindsight needed to help move forward. Using a balanced and holistic approach to care helps people assess how different patterns affect one\u2019s well-being, including emotional, physical, spiritual, and mental. Through many years of practice, Jeff has believed that many clients are indifferent about theory, modality, and technique. It is connection, empathy, and trust in professional help, coupled with a sense of internal motivation, that can ultimately lead someone toward finding hope, health, and healing.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working in Mental Health since 2001<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working at Bridge House since 2023<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PRIMARY THERAPIST<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":1805,"template":"","department":[8],"class_list":{"0":"post-155","1":"team","2":"type-team","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"department-clinical","7":"entry"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team\/155","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1805"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=155"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"department","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/department?post=155"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
