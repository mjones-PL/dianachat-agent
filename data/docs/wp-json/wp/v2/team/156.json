As an overnight employee at a residential treatment center for teenage girls, she discovered her passion for supporting individuals struggling with mental health challenges.  Throughout her time in the field, she has gained invaluable experience as a Certified Life Coach, teaching adolescents and young adults the life skills they need based on Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Cognitive Behavior Therapy models.  Before accepting the Admissions Associate position at Bridge House, Eliza spent seven years working in various leadership roles and eventually obtained a background in writing and overseeing a local Transitional Living Program.  This opportunity provided her with a Certification in Trauma-Informed Care. It commissioned her with tasks such as managing and training her program\u2019s staff, conferring treatment strategies with education consultants, and providing goal-oriented support for residents and their families. This provided her with first-hand experience in helping those trying to find the right help for their loved ones.&nbsp; Her previous experience allows her to meet with prospective families and guide them through selecting Bridge House for their journey in recovery.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PERSONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Eliza was born and raised in Utah.
