Having worked in that industry for over 16 years, Brooke has a strong knowledge of the power of supplementation.  She believes that while some supplements can be beneficial, they are not all as revolutionary as we may be led to believe. When the next phase of her career opened, Brooke began&nbsp;creating weight loss menu plans for bloggers and currently works in the wellness industry for a local fitness camp that draws clients worldwide.  Brooke also has one nationally recognized weight management certification from the American Dietetic Association.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brooke loves people and is passionate about helping them heal using the power of food.  Her philosophy on nutrition is firmly on the functional nutrition side of the plate.  The functional power of food that informs her dietetic practice also showed up in her personal life, when Brooke helped her teenage daughter heal from a battle with&nbsp;<em>clostridium difficile<\/em>&nbsp;<em>colitis<\/em>.  When this health challenge left Brooke\u2019s daughter with post-infectious IBS, she quickly realized that a handful of medications were not the solution to helping her daughter heal and thrive.  Ultimately, Brooke and her daughter found a food-centered solution by eliminating several triggering foods from her diet.  This solution has kept her daughter not only symptom-free but also medication-free.  From both personal and professional experience, Brooke understands the strong connections between gut health and mental health, and she is constantly advocating this message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PERSONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Brooke can be found on her mountain bike or fat bike, tearing up the trails if not at a track meet or soccer game for her kids.  If there is light still left in the day, Brooke can be found putting around in her organic garden, listening to podcasts, or reading books about health and wellness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Brooke believes that hope, healing and health come as individually tailored solutions.  She knows that each resident comes to Bridge House with varied life challenges and needs that make them unique.  Brooke helps them navigate their path to wellness by approaching them from a place of love, patience, and empathy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working in healthcare since 1998<br><br>Working at Bridge House since 2020<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CLINICAL DIETITIAN <\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":166,"template":"","department":[6,10],"class_list":{"0":"post-157","1":"team","2":"type-team","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"department-dietary","7":"department-medical-specialists","8":"entry"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team\/157","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/166"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=157"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"department","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/department?post=157"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
