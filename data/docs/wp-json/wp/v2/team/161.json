Teaming up with the Executive Chef, they created an eclectic Italian Seafood menu. After growing the restaurant&#8217;s clientele and being named \u2018Bay Area&#8217;s best food and entertainment of the year\u2019 awarded 2 years in a row, he decided to go off on his own and help other small restaurant owners grow their businesses. Over the 20 years of Louie\u2019s culinary career, he helped develop and rebrand 14 privately owned restaurants nationwide. Gaining knowledge of different regions&#8217; recipes and styles has allowed Louie to create his unique style of culinary recipes which he calls \u201cHappy Food\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PERSONAL<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>When Louie is not creating culinary delights, you will find him either in the mountains, on a lake, or lost on the ocean&#8217;s shores.&nbsp; Louie was born and raised in beautiful Southern California and spent most of his time in the Pacific Ocean. He has lived in several states, from the West Coast to the East Coast and many in between. He is a happy father to 6 children and a grandfather to 1, with another grandchild on the way. He has always had fish as pets, with as many as 12 operating fish tanks simultaneously. Louie feels they are much more fun to watch than television. Louie enjoys football, with his two favorite teams being the Oregon Ducks and Green Bay Packers. He is also a huge fan of the American Hockey League and follows the Ice Dogs. In his free time, Louie experiments with different types of art expression, from canvas painting to chalk or pencil drawing. He loves doing landscape and tree art, all things Mother Earth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOPE, HEALTH &amp; HEALING<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Health is the foundation of our well-being, and bonds our lives\u2019 physical, mental, and emotional characteristics. The culinary department must maintain the highest standards of quality and nutritional diets for our residents. Having a healthy, consistent diet aids in the healing process. Healthy food in your body will ease the cravings for sweet, fatty, salty concoctions and can reduce high levels of cortisol, stimulate the production of the feel-good hormone dopamine, and increases the level of calming, mood-enhancing serotonin. Hope is the belief that things can get better, even in the face of adversity. Hope is a powerful motivator that helps us overcome challenges and achieve our goals. Healing is the process of restoring health and hope when they have been lost or damaged. It involves caring for ourselves and others, seeking help when needed, and finding the paths our feet are meant to follow. These concepts manifest a powerful framework for living a happy and fulfilling life.\u00a0<br><br>Working in culinary arts since 1991<br><br>Working at Bridge House since 2023<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>EXECUTIVE CHEF<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":1817,"template":"","department":[6],"class_list":{"0":"post-161","1":"team","2":"type-team","3":"status-publish","4":"has-post-thumbnail","6":"department-dietary","7":"entry"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team\/161","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/team"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/team"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1817"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=161"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"department","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/bridgehousehealth.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/department?post=161"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
